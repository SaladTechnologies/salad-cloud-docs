## API Reference

### Send a POST request with job parameters

To interact with the API, you first need to send a POST request to the endpoint url mentioned above. Salad API Key should be sent as a header: "Salad-Api-Key": "Your Salad Key". As a result you will recieve a job id. Follow the pattern below for the request body:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
    "language_code": "en",
    "word_level_timestamps": true,
    "diarization": true,
    "srt": true
  },
  "metadata": {
    "my-job-id": 1234
  }
}

```

## Parameters

### input
An object that configures the job.
- **url**: Publicly accessible URL of the media file to transcribe.

## Example cURL Send for Transcription

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{my-organization}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs \
   -H "Salad-Api-Key: "your salad api key" \
   -d '{
      "input": {
         "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
         "language_code": "en",
         "word_level_timestamps": true,
         "diarization": true,
         "srt": true
      }
   }'
```



## Example cURL Get Transcript
Once you have the job ID, you need to send a GET request with that job ID appended to the URL to retrieve the output. The pattern for the GET request is as follows:


```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{your-organization}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job_id}" \
   -H "Salad-Api-Key: {your-api-key}"
```

- **Example: Using the Transcription API via Postman**
  - Open postman and create a new HTTP request
  - Set the HTTP method to POST
  - Enter the API endpoint URL
  - Add API Key Authorization
    - Key: Salad-Api-Key
    - Value: provide your Salad API Key
    - Add to: header
  - Add the Request Body
    - select the raw option, and choose JSON from the dropdown menu
    - Add the URL of your audio file and parameters in the request body as shown in the example.
      - the file URL must be a direct download link
  - Send the Request
    - Click the Send button. The API will respond with the job id
  - Send another GET request with that job id at the end of the URL
    - Click the Send button. The API will respond with the transcription result in JSON format.

### Cost
 - Managed endpoints is being offered for free for a limited time!


 ## Transcription Service Automation

In the coming weeks, our transcription service will be enhanced with webhook functionality, allowing you to receive notifications when your transcription jobs are completed. Until then, you can use the following Python code snippet to automate the process of sending requests and retrieving transcription results.

### Pass 1: Submitting Audio Files for Transcription
This part of the script submits audio files for transcription and collects job IDs. The job IDs are used in the second pass to check the status and retrieve the results.

```bash
import requests
import json
# Set the organization name, url, and API key
organization_name = "your_organization_name"
url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
salad_key = "your_salad_key"
language_code = "en"
# Add your audio links here 
list_of_audio_files = [
    "audio_url",
    "audio_url",
    "audio_url",
]
# If you want to pull links from a file, you can use the following code
# with open('audio_links.txt', 'r') as f:
#     list_of_audio_files = f.readlines()
# Placeholder for job_ids
list_of_job_ids = []
headers = {
    "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "accept": "application/json",
}
# Pass 1: Submit audio files for transcription
# Loop through the list of audio files and construct body of each request
for audio_file in list_of_audio_files:
    data = {
        "input": {
            "url": audio_file,
            "language_code": language_code,
            "word_level_timestamps": True,
            "diarization": True,
            "srt": True,
        }
    }
    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    # Pull job id from response. And save it to a list or a file
    job_id = response.json()["id"]
    list_of_job_ids.append(job_id)
    #save job_ids to a file if needed (uncomment the code below)
    # job_id_str = f'"{job_id}",'
    # # Open a file and write the job_id to it
    # with open('queue_test.txt', 'a') as f:
    #     f.write(job_id_str + '\n')

```
### Pass 2: Checking Job Status and Retrieving Results

This part of the script checks the status of each transcription job periodically and retrieves the results once the transcription is completed.

```bash
    # Pass 2. Loop though the job_ids and get the results
    # If you use both passes in the same script, just continue. 
    # If you use scripts separatly you need to set up connection again 
    # and initialize the list of job ids : 
    # Uncomment the code below if you need to 
    # import requests
    # import json
    # Set the organization name, url, and API key
    # organization_name = "your_organization_name"
    # url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
    # salad_key = "your_salad_key"
    # language_code = "en"
    # headers = {
    #     "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
    #     "Content-Type": "application/json",
    #     "accept": "application/json",
    # }
    # Pull list from a file:
    # with open('queue_test.txt', 'r') as f:
    #     list_of_job_ids = f.readlines()
    # or initialize the list manually
    # list_of_job_ids = ["job_id1", "job_id2", "job_id3", "job_id4"]
import time
# Loop though the job_ids and get the results
while len(list_of_job_ids) > 0:
    for job in list_of_job_ids:
        response_url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/salad/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job}"
        response = requests.get(response_url, headers=headers)
        if response.json()['status'] == 'running' or response.json()['status'] == 'pending':
            print(f"Job {job} is still {response.json()['status']}, waiting for retry...")
            # wait for 30 seconds and retry
            time.sleep(30) 
            continue
        if response.json()['status'] == 'succeded':
            #save the response to a file
            with open(f'result_{job}.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                json.dump(response.json(), f, ensure_ascii=False)  
            #remove the job_id from the list
            list_of_job_ids.remove(job)
        else:
            print(f"Job {job} failed, waiting for retry...")
            # wait for 30 seconds and retry
            time.sleep(30)
            continue

```
