## Connecting

1. After you request SGS service in a region, Salad will provision and test your infrastructure before sending you the connection information, which will include a unique SGS hostname, port number, password, and other basic information. 
<Note>Note that this documentation assumes you are using HTTP CONNECT requests. SGS also supports HAProxy's PROXY v2 protocol. Learn how to use it [here.](/gateway-service/proxy-v2)</Note>
2. All requests should be made through the SGS server using this connection information. The SGS server will then route them to the appropriate Salad node. For example, `https://SESSIONID:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT/`

    - Let's break down each component: `SESSIONID`, `PASSWORD`, `HOSTNAME`, and `PORT`.
        - `SESSIONID`
            - You can pass any session ID you like, as a string encoded in ASCII or UTF8. There are no character length limits enforced. Each session ID will be associated with one salad node. Because all requests sent through a single session ID will be proxied through the same node, we recommend using separate session IDs for unique sessions. If a node goes offline for any reason, all connections that it was servicing will be automatically distributed to one or more nodes using a modified least connections algorithm.
        - `PASSWORD`
            - The password for connecting to SGS will be shared with you using a 1Password link before beginning the trial period.
        - `HOSTNAME`
            - The hostname of the SGS server. It is typically in the format `sgs-{unique_string}.salad.com`, and will be shared with you before beginning the trial period.
        - `PORT`
            - The port of the SGS server will be shared with you before beginning the trial period.
        <Note>Proxy authentication with the SGS server MUST be made using TLS (https endpoint). In addition, requests can only be made to destination addresses using HTTPS.</Note>
3. Using curl, you can check the IP address and region of a node connected to one of your SGS servers:
```shell sgs_connection.sh 
curl -x 'https://session123:PASSWORD@sgs-NAME.salad.com:PORT' https://www.ipinfo.io
```
<Note>Changing the session ID and resending this request will often - but not always - return a different IP address. Because of the nature of the least-loaded routing algorithm used by SGS, and the fact that SGS nodes can support multiple streaming connections simultaneously, multiple connections (session IDs) may be loaded on a single node.</Note>
