### Requesting PROXY v2 support

SGS can also support HAproxyâ€™s PROXY v2 protocol, which uses a client certificate rather than a password for
authentication. If you require PROXY protocol support, please contact your account manager and we'll be happy to
generate a client cert for you and enable PROXY v2 protocol support on the SGS server.

<Note>
  PROXY v2 protocol may be simpler to implement depending on how your infrastructure is configured, and may offer some
  performance benefits over HTTP CONNECT.
