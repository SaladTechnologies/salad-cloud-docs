Always ensure that you are only routing traffic through SGS, which is destined for approved streaming providers or
endpoints used in testing (e.g., ipinfo.com, fast.com, or static hosted files for measuring download speed and latency).
If you are unsure whether a specific streaming service is supported, please check with your account manager or refer to
your contract.
