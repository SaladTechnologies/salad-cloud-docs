# Contributing

Thanks for being here and for being awesome! üëç

The following sections outline the different ways to contribute to the project.

## Repository Organization

SaladCloud documentation follows [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) principles.

![Diataxis framework](./diataxis.png)

In our documentation, we label the "Explanation" section "Products", but otherwise, the structure is the same.

- **Products**: Information about the products, what they do, what they cost, and how to use them.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides which teach how to use the products. These do not try to achieve a particular
  outcome, but rather to teach a particular skill. They do not assume background knowledge.
- **How-to Guides**: Guides that explain how to do something of practical value, using the products. They assume some
  background knowledge.
- **Reference**: API documentation for the products.

### Directory Structure

- The directory structure should match the final website structure.
- Images should be placed in a sibling directory to the markdown file that references them, named `images`.

## Discussing

The easiest way to contribute to the project is by participating in community discussions on the [SaladCloud Discord
server][discord]. The community often chimes in with helpful advice when you have a question, and you may also find
yourself providing answers and helping others. Be sure to review the [code of conduct][code-of-conduct-page] before
participating.

_Please do not use GitHub issues to ask a question._ We will politely close a GitHub issue that asks a question and
kindly refer you to the SaladCloud Discord server or [official support][support].

_Please do not use public GitHub issues to report a security vulnerability._ Instead, refer to our [security
policy][security-page] for responsible disclosure options.

## Reporting Issues

You can create a [GitHub issue][issues] to report problems with our documentation. You can also contact [official
support][support] if you found a problem with the product.

_Please do not use public GitHub issues to report a security vulnerability._ Instead, refer to our [security
policy][security-page] for responsible disclosure options.

## Adding Endpoints

To add a new endpoint (like dreambooth or transcription) to the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Place the openapi3 compatible input and output json schema for the endpoint in the `scripts/inputs-and-outputs`
   directory
2. Place a config file in `scripts/endpoint-schema-configs`, with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "baseSchema": "api-specs/salad-cloud.json",
     "inputSchema": "scripts/inputs-and-outputs/dreambooth-sd15-input.json",
     "outputSchema": "scripts/inputs-and-outputs/dreambooth-output.json",
     "endpointId": "dreambooth-sd15",
     "endpointName": "Dreambooth Training API - Stable Diffusion 1.5",
     "schemaName": "DreamboothSD15Training",
     "apiDocPath": "reference/dreambooth/sd15"
   }
   ```
3. To run all config files, use `./scripts/add-all-endpoints`

## Adding Recipes

To add a new recipe to the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Place the openapi3 spec for the recipe in the `api-specs` directory, named for the recipe. It should match the
   directory name in the `salad-recipes` repository.
2. Run `./scripts/add-recipe <path-to-spec>` to generate the recipe pages.
3. Add the recipe to the navigation in `mint.json`. Find the `navigation` array in `mint.json`, and add your recipe
   pages to the appropriate section.
