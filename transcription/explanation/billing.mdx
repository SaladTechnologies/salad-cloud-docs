## How We Calculate the Charge

You are charged based on the duration of your audio file, calculated as a fraction of an hour with two decimal places
for precision. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Convert Audio Duration to Hours** Each audio file's length is measured in seconds and divided by 3,600 to calculate
   the duration in hours.

2. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth** The resulting duration is rounded to two decimal places for clarity and precision.

3. **Minimum Billing Unit** The smallest unit we charge for is 0.01 hours, equivalent to 36 seconds of audio. This
   ensures even very short files are fairly billed.

4. **Risk-Free Billing** If a transcription fails for any reason, you will not be charged.
