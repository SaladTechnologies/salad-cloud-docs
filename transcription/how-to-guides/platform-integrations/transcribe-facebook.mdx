title: 'How to Transcribe Facebook Videos with Salad Transcription API'
---

_Last Updated: April 7, 2025_

Facebook URLs are not natively downloadable, which can be a challenge when working with the Salad Transcription API,
which requires downloadable audio links. However, you can extract audio from Facebook videos, upload it to
[Salad Simple Storage Service](/storage/explanation/overview) free of charge, and use the resulting link with the API.

This guide will walk you through the process to batch transcribe multiple Facebook videos and save the outputs.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Python Installed**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher.
2. **Libraries Installed**: Use the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp requests
   ```
3. **FFmpeg Installed**: FFmpeg is needed by yt-dlp for processing audio:
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
   - **MacOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Windows**: [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system PATH.
4. **Salad API Key**: Ensure you have a valid [Salad API key](/reference/api-usage#get-your-saladcloud-api-key).

---

## **Step 1: Import Libraries**

To start, import the required Python libraries:

```python
# For extracting audio from Facebook
import yt_dlp

# For handling HTTP requests and file paths
import requests
from pathlib import Path
import time

# For working with JSON files (batch processing).
import json
```

## **Step 2: Define Functions**

**1. Download Audio from Facebook**

This function downloads the best-quality audio from a Facebook video:

```python
def download_audio_from_Facebook(video_url, output_format="mp3"):
    """
    Downloads audio from a Facebook video in the specified format.

    Args:
        video_url (str): The URL of the Facebook video.
        output_format (str): Desired audio format (default: "mp3").

    Returns:
        str: The filename of the downloaded audio file.
    """
    try:
        ydl_opts = {
            'format': 'bestaudio/best',
            'postprocessors': [{
                'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
                'preferredcodec': output_format,
                'preferredquality': '128',
            }],
            'outtmpl': '%(id)s.%(ext)s',
        }
        with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
            info = ydl.extract_info(video_url, download=True)
            return f"{info['id']}.{output_format}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading audio: {e}")
        return None
```

- Facebook videos must be in the format `https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/38947598374958739457/`.
  Reels, or other video URL formats are not currently supported.

**2. Upload Audio to Salad Storage**

This function uploads the audio file to Salad Storage and generates a presigned URL:

```python
def upload_to_salad_storage(audio_file_path, salad_api_key, organization_name, mime_type="audio/mpeg"):
    """
    Uploads an audio file to Salad Storage and generates a signed access URL.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        salad_api_key (str): Salad API key for authentication.
        organization_name (str): Name of the Salad organization.
        mime_type (str): MIME type of the file (default: "audio/mpeg").

    Returns:
        str: The signed URL for the uploaded file.
    """
    try:
      # Generate the upload URL
      file_name = f"audio/{Path(audio_file_path).name}"
      upload_url = f"https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/{organization_name}/files/{file_name}"

      # Prepare headers for authentication
      headers = {"Salad-Api-Key": salad_api_key}

      # Prepare data for the upload
      data = {
          "mimeType": mime_type,
          "sign": "true",  # Request a signed URL
          "signatureExp": 3 * 24 * 60 * 60  # 3 days in seconds
      }

      # Prepare the file to be uploaded
      with open(audio_file_path, "rb") as f:
          files = {"file": (Path(audio_file_path).name, f)}
          response = requests.put(upload_url, headers=headers, data=data, files=files)
          response.raise_for_status()

      # Extract and return the signed URL
      signed_url = response.json().get("url")
      if not signed_url:
          raise ValueError("Signed URL not returned by the API.")
      return signed_url

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error uploading to Salad storage: {e}")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"API response error: {ve}")
    return None
```

## **Step 3: Define Variables**

Set the variables required for the process:

```python
# Salad Storage credentials
SALAD_API_KEY = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Salad API key
ORGANIZATION_NAME = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME"  # Replace with your organization name

# List of Facebook URLs
facebook_urls = [
    "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/38947598374958739457/",
    "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/39475903749587893745/",
    "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/29837453749587394857/"
]
```

- Adjust the `SALAD_API_KEY` and `ORGANIZATION_NAME` variables to your Salad API key and organization name.
- Add all of your Facebook URLs to the `Facebook_URLS` list.
- Facebook videos must be in the format `https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/38947598374958739457/`.
  Reels, or other video URL formats are not currently supported.

## **Step 4: Batch Process Multiple URLs**

To process multiple Facebook URLs, use the following script:

```python
# Dictionary to store mappings of Facebook URLs to Salad Storage links
url_mappings = {}

for url in Facebook_URLS:
    try:
        print(f"Processing: {url}")
        audio_path = download_audio_from_Facebook(url)  # Step 1: Download audio
        print(f"Downloaded audio successfully, uploading to Salad Storage...")
        storage_url = upload_to_salad_storage(audio_path, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME)  # Step 2: Upload audio
        url_mappings[url] = storage_url
        Path(audio_path).unlink()  # Clean up local file
        print(f"Processed successfully: {url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to process {url}: {e}")

# Save mappings to a JSON file
with open("url_mappings.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(url_mappings, f, indent=4)

print("Batch processing complete. URL mappings saved to url_mappings.json.")

```

### **Expected Output**

A url_mappings.json file is generated with the mappings:

```json
{
  "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/29837453749587394857/": "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token=TOKEN",
  "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/39475903749587893745/": "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token=TOKEN",
  "https://www.facebook.com/user/videos/name-of-video/29837453749587394857/": "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token=TOKEN"
}
```

- Salad Storage supports a max file size of 100MB. If the Facebook video is too long, you may need to
  [split the audio](/transcription/how-to-guides/technical/splitting-large-audio-files) or use a different storage
  solution.

## **Step 5: Send Prepared URLs to the Salad Transcription API**

Once the audio files are uploaded to Salad Storage and you have the corresponding signed URLs, the final step is to send
these URLs to the Salad Transcription API for processing.

You can find detailed instructions on how to send requests a to the Salad Transcription API in the official
documentation:

[Salad Transcription API Documentation](/transcription/tutorials/transcription-quick-start)

Below, we provide a function to send a transcription request to the API and retrieve the `job_id`.

### **Function to Send a Transcription Request**

This function sends a transcription request to the Salad Transcription API for a single URL:

```python
def send_transcription_request(audio_url, organization_name, salad_key, language_code="en", input_params=None):
    """
    Sends a transcription request to the Salad Transcription API with dynamic input parameters.

    Args:
        audio_url (str): The signed Salad Storage URL for the audio file.
        api_endpoint (str): The Salad Transcription API endpoint.
        salad_key (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        language_code (str): The language of the audio file (default: "en").
        input_params (dict): Additional input parameters to include in the request.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API, including the job ID.
    """
    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
    # Prepare the input dictionary, appending the audio URL and language code
    input_data = input_params.copy() if input_params else {}
    input_data["url"] = audio_url
    input_data["language_code"] = language_code

    # Request body
    data = {
        "input": input_data
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

# Define dynamic input parameters. Discover more about available parameters in the official documentation.
# Example:
input_parameters = {
    "sentence_level_timestamps": False,
    "diarization": False,
}

jobs = {}

# Send the transcription request
for uploaded_url in url_mappings.values():
    try:
        response = send_transcription_request(
            audio_url=uploaded_url,
            organization_name=ORGANIZATION_NAME,
            salad_key=SALAD_API_KEY,
            language_code="en",  # Specify the language code if needed
            input_params=input_parameters
        )
        print(f"Transcription request submitted successfully. Job ID: {response['id']}")

        jobs[uploaded_url] = response["id"]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending transcription request: {e}")

# Save jobs to a JSON file
with open("jobs.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(jobs, f, indent=4)
    print(f"Job IDs mapped to Salad Storage URLs saved to jobs.json")
```

### **Expected Output**

If the request is successful, the API will return a job_id and our function will print it out:

```text
Transcription request submitted successfully. Job ID: 6ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b2
```

You should also have a `jobs.json` file with the mappings:

```json
{
  "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token": "1ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b1",
  "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token": "2ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b2",
  "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3?token": "3ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b3"
}
```

The `job_id` is a unique identifier for the transcription job. You can use it later to check the job status or retrieve
the final result.

## **Step 6: Retrieve the Transcription Result**

If you did not specify a webhook to receive the result, you can manually retrieve the transcription result using the
`job_id` returned in Step 5.

### **Function to Retrieve Transcription Results**

This function retrieves the result of a transcription job from the Salad Transcription API:

```python
def get_transcription_result(job_id, salad_key, organization_name):
    """
    Retrieves the transcription result from the Salad Transcription API for a given job ID.

    Args:
        job_id (str): The unique identifier of the transcription job.
        salad_key (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        organization_name (str): Name of the Salad organization.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API containing the job status and transcription result.
    """
    # Construct the Salad API endpoint for retrieving job results
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job_id}"

    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

for job_ids in jobs.values():
    # Retrieve the transcription result
    while True:
        # Retrieve the transcription result
        time.sleep(5) # Adjust this value if needed, depending on whether your transcription is long or short.
        try:
            result = get_transcription_result(
                job_id=job_ids,
                salad_key=SALAD_API_KEY,
                organization_name=ORGANIZATION_NAME
            )
            job_id=job_ids
            if result["status"] in ["created", "started", "running", "failed"]:
                print(f'Job ID: {job_id} status is {result["status"]}')
            elif result["output"]:
                with open(f"{job_id}.txt", "w") as f:
                    text = str(result["output"]["text"])
                    f.write(text)
                print(f'Job ID: {job_id} status is {result["status"]}')
                with open(f'output_{job_id}.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    json.dump(result, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
                break
            else:
                print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f'Error retrieving transcription result: {e}')
            break
```

### **Expected Output**

If the job is still processing:

```text
Job ID: 1ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b1 status is running
```

If the job is completed:

```text
Job ID: 1ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b1 status is succeeded
```

The completed transcriptions will be saved in a text file with the `job_id` as the filename:
