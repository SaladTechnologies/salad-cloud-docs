## Introduction

The Salad Transcription Python SDK allows developers to integrate **Salad Transcription APIs** directly into their
Python workflows. With minimal setup, you can submit audio or video files for transcription, receive timestamps,
diarization, and even LLM-powered extras such as summaries, translations, sentiment analysis, and more.

This SDK simplifies communication with SaladCloud Transcription API's, automatically handling file uploads to S4
storage, job polling, and LLM features usage.

> **Note:** The SDK requires **Python 3.9 or newer**
