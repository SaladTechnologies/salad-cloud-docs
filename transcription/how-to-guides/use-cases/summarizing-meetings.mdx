title: 'How to Summarize Meetings and Phone Calls with Salad Transcription API'
---

_Last Updated: March 26, 2025_

For summarizing, you have two options. You can either use the `summarize` input parameter, or you can use the
`custom_prompt` input parameter. The `summarize` input parameter is a simple way to summarize the entire transcription
in a given number of words. The `custom_prompt` input parameter allows you to provide a custom prompt to the LLM to
generate a more advanced summary of the transcription with custom requirements or formatting.

## Custom input parameters

### summarize

In this example, we'll use a Python script to transcribe an audio file and tell it to use the `summarize` input
parameter set to 100 words. We'll use the following input parameters:

```python
payload = {"input": {
        "summarize": 100,
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
```

### custom_prompt

In this example, we'll use a Python script to transcribe an audio file and tell it to use the `custom_prompt` input
parameter to generate the summarization. We'll use the following input parameters:

```python
payload = {"input": {
        "custom_prompt": "The following is a virtual meeting/phone call transcription. Summarize the call and list the important items discussed. Format it in a markdown compatible list to make it easy to read.",
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
```

## Python script

We're going to create a file and name it `summarize.py`. We're then going to use the above parameters in the following
Python script:

### summarize

```python
import requests
import time

audio_file_url = "url/to/audio/file.mp3" # replace with your audio file URL

salad_api_key = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY" # replace with your Salad API key
organization_name = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME" # replace with your organization name

payload = {"input": {
        "summarize": 100,
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
headers = {
    "Salad-Api-Key": salad_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}


url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

response = response.json()
job_id=response["id"]
print (f'Job ID: {job_id}')

while True:
  time.sleep(5)
  try:
      result = requests.get(f"{url}/{job_id}", headers=headers)
      result = result.json()
      if result["status"] == "created" or result["status"] == "pending" or result["status"] == "started" or result["status"] == "running":
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
      elif result["status"] == "failed":
          print(f'Job failed')
          break
      elif result["output"]:
          print(result["output"]["summary"])
          break
      else:
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
  except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error retrieving transcription result: {e}')
        break
```

- Make sure to replace `url/to/audio/file.mp3` with the URL of your audio file.
- Replace `YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY` with
  [your Salad API key](/container-engine/tutorials/quickstart-api#step-1-obtain-your-api-key).
- Replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
- Run the script using with `python action-items.py`.

In this script, we're using the `summarize` input parameter to summarize the meeting to 100 words. We capture the output
using the `summary` field. We're then printing the result of this field to the console. You'll also see the status of
the transcription job as it progresses.

### custom_prompt

```python
import requests
import time

audio_file_url = "url/to/audio/file.mp3" # replace with your audio file URL

salad_api_key = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY" # replace with your Salad API key
organization_name = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME" # replace with your organization name

payload = {"input": {
        "custom_prompt": "The following is a virtual meeting/phone call transcription. Summarize the call and list the important items discussed. Format it in a markdown compatible list to make it easy to read.",
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
headers = {
    "Salad-Api-Key": salad_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}


url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

response = response.json()
job_id=response["id"]
print (f'Job ID: {job_id}')

while True:
  time.sleep(5)
  try:
      result = requests.get(f"{url}/{job_id}", headers=headers)
      result = result.json()
      if result["status"] == "created" or result["status"] == "pending" or result["status"] == "started" or result["status"] == "running":
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
      elif result["status"] == "failed":
          print(f'Job failed')
          break
      elif result["output"]:
          print(result["output"]["llm_result"])
          break
      else:
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
  except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error retrieving transcription result: {e}')
        break
```

- Make sure to replace `url/to/audio/file.mp3` with the URL of your audio file.
- Replace `YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY` with
  [your Salad API key](/container-engine/tutorials/quickstart-api#step-1-obtain-your-api-key).
- Replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
- Run the script using with `python summarize.py`.

In this script, we're using the `custom_prompt` input parameter to tell the LLM to summarize the meeting and list the
important items. We capture the output using the `llm_result` field. We're then printing the result of this field to the
console. You'll also see the status of the transcription job as it progresses.
