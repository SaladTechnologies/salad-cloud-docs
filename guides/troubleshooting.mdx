description: Troubleshooting common issues with Salad Container Engine workloads.
---

The following guide addresses common issues encountered when running container workloads on Salad. These solutions will
help resolve frequent problems with downloads, container failures, networking, and access. If issues persist after
applying these fixes, please consult our documentation or contact support.

### **Downloading Times**

Salad nodes often run on residential internet connections, so downloads may take longer than expected. If download times
takes longer then expected try:

- Checking the logs to confirm the container isn’t failing repeatedly.
- Reducing your container image size to speed things up.

_Note that the progress bar is a conservative estimate—actual download time may vary._

### **Repeated Start Failures**

If your container repeatedly fails on startup:

- Some base images (like ubuntu) exit immediately after setup—add a sleep command to keep them running.
- Ensure your image is built for AMD64 (not ARM64) and properly configured for GPU workloads.
- Test the container locally first to rule out configuration issues.

### **Container Exits Unexpectedly**

Salad may restart failed containers on the same machine to minimize downtime.

Check the exit code in system events for debugging:

- Exit code 137 usually means the container ran out of RAM—try increasing allocation.
- Most exit codes are application-specific, not SaladCloud issues.

### **503 Errors \- Container Gateway Issues**

If you see 503 errors when accessing your workload:

- Ensure your container supports [IPv6](https://docs.salad.com/products/sce/gateway/enabling-ipv6#enabling-ipv6).
- Double-check that the correct port is exposed.
- If IPv6 is configured, the server may still be starting—set up a readiness probe to delay traffic until ready.

### **Unable to Access Salad Terminal**

The Salad terminal is in beta and may sometimes fail to connect. If this occurs try:

- Refreshing the page or trying a different instance.
- Keep in mind that nodes are spot instances and can disconnect unexpectedly.
- For more reliable access, consider using
  [Tailscale](https://docs.salad.com/guides/tailscale-integration/basic#add-tailscale-support-into-saladcloud-workloads)
  or similar tools.

### **Container Pull Failures**

If Salad can’t pull your container image:

- Verify the image source is correct.
- Verify the image name and registry are correct.
- Check that credentials (for private images) are valid.
- Ensure the image is in Docker/OCI format and built for AMD64.
- Ensure the image is \<= 35GB in size (compressed).
