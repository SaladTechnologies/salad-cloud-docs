## Introduction

For performance and cost benchmarks of running [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) on SaladCloud, please refer to
[this blog post](https://blog.salad.com/gromacs-benchmark). You can also check
[the GitHub repository](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/tree/main/gromacs-benchmark) for the benchmarking
Dockerfile and detailed test methodology.

Molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS can run from several hours to multiple days, depending on factors such as
CPU/GPU performance, system size (number of atoms or molecules), simulation length (number of steps), and the level of
physical detail modeled. Large-scale simulations often produce substantial output—ranging up to tens of
gigabytes—including trajectories, energy profiles, and other results.

SaladCloud operates on a distributed network of interruptible nodes, meaning any node running your tasks may shut down
unexpectedly and all runtime data are removed (data persistence must be managed via external cloud storage). Despite
this, most Salad nodes remain stable for over 10 hours at a time.

To run GROMACS effectively on SaladCloud, it's recommended to divide large simulation tasks into manageable chunks—such
as 30-minute runs—and execute them sequentially. This chunked approach is natively supported by GROMACS and can be
implemented with just a few lines of code. With this adapted workflow, each chunk generates its own small output files
along with the updated checkpoint, all of which can be uploaded to cloud storage immediately. When resuming after node
reallocation, only the input file and the checkpoint file need to be downloaded from the cloud—**eliminating the need to
upload or download large files at any point.**

Salad nodes are globally distributed, leading to variations in network latency, geographic distance, and throughput to
specific cloud storage endpoints. Many nodes also have asymmetric bandwidth, with upload speeds typically lower than
download speeds. Nevertheless, more than 90% of nodes can upload over 10 GB of data per hour—more than sufficient for
GROMACS workloads. For detailed performance metrics, refer to
[the cloud storage benchmarks on SaladCloud](/tutorials/high-performance-storage-solutions#cloud-storage-benchmarking-on-saladcloud).

## Single-Replica Container Group vs. Job Queue System

As a starting point, we recommend creating a dedicated Single-Replica Container Group (**SRCG**) for each simulation
task on SaladCloud. This setup is easy to launch and works well for larger simulations—spanning tens of hours or
multiple days. Task-specific configurations, such as the number of steps, chunking intervals, and input/output paths in
cloud storage—can be passed to the instance via environment variables.

While tasks are briefly paused during node reallocation after interruptions, our testing across a large number of
samples shows that total downtime remains under 4% of the overall runtime.

On the other hand, if you’re running a large number of simulation tasks—a job queue becomes essential to ensure
efficiency and scalability. Systems like GCP Pub/Sub, AWS SQS, Salad Kelpie, or custom solutions using Redis or Kafka
can be used to distribute jobs (task-specific configurations) across a pool of Salad nodes. If a node fails during job
execution, the job queue ensures the job is retried immediately on another available node.

You can further implement autoscaling by monitoring the number of available jobs in the queue and dynamically adjusting
the number of Salad nodes. This approach ensures that your target number of tasks is completed within a defined
timeframe, while also allowing cost control during periods of lower demand.

This guide focuses on the SRCG-based approach. A separate guide will cover job queue integration.

## Chunking Large Simulations

To demonstrate how to split a GROMACS simulation into chunks, consider the following example.

```bash
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps 200000
```

This command runs a 200,000-step GPU-accelerated simulation using the system defined in the `j1.tpr` file. It uses a
single MPI rank and 8 OpenMP threads, with `j1` as the default filename prefix for all output files. All major
components of the simulation—non-bonded interactions, PME, bonded interactions, and integration—are offloaded to the
GPU. CPU threads are pinned to specific cores to ensure consistent performance.

Let’s take a closer look at the input, checkpoint and output files generated by the simulation.

<img src="/guides/molecular-dynamics-simulation/images/gs_normal.png" />

- **.tpr** – The portable binary run input file. It contains everything required to run the simulation: topology,
  parameters, coordinates, velocities, and simulation settings.
- **.cpt** – The checkpoint file, updated at configurable intervals (every 15 minutes by default) during the simulation.
  **It allows the simulation to resume from the last saved state after an interruption.** While its contents change, the
  file size remains constant for a given input. A **\_prev.cpt** file may be created to store the previous checkpoint
  when a new checkpoint is written.
- **.edr, .log, .trr, .xtc** – **These output files** are continuously and rapidly updated during the simulation, with
  new data appended at regular step intervals. Over long runs, they can grow significantly in size—possibly reaching
  tens of gigabytes, especially the .trr file.
  - .edr stores energy terms such as temperature, pressure, and kinetic/potential energy.
  - .log records detailed information about the run, including settings, performance metrics, and diagnostic messages.
  - .trr is a full-precision trajectory file containing coordinates, velocities, and forces at each saved step.
  - .xtc is a compressed trajectory file that stores only atomic coordinates; it may be generated in some simulations to
    save storage space.
- **.gro** – A coordinate file generated upon simulation completion. It represents the final state of the system and can
  serve as input for a continuation or new simulation.

**Directly backing up the checkpoint and output files while they are actively being written—especially at different
frequencies—can lead to data inconsistencies or corruption, leaving these files out of sync.**

A better approach is to split the simulation into smaller chunks, each running for a short duration. After each chunk
finishes, the output files and their corresponding, properly aligned checkpoint file can be safely generated and
uploaded to cloud storage.

To resume the simulation, extract the number of completed steps from the checkpoint file, then continue the run using
the original input file, the updated number of remaining steps, and the checkpoint. In case of node reallocation, the
new node only needs to download the input file and the checkpoint file to continue the simulation.

Below are the commands to implement the adapted workflow:

```bash
# Download the input file (j1.tpr).

# Run the simulation for 200,000 steps with the input file, stopping gracefully after 1 minute.
# The -noappend option ensures that output files are created with incremented suffixes automatically, rather than appending to existing files.
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -noappend -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps 200000 -maxh 0.016

# Files generated after the first chunk and uploaded to cloud storage:
j1.cpt
j1_prev.cpt
j1.part0001.edr
j1.part0001.log
j1.part0001.trr

# After node reallocation, the new node only needs to download the input file (j1.tpr) and the checkpoint file (j1.cpt) from cloud storage

# Extract the number of completed steps (47,200 in this example) from the checkpoint file.
gmx dump -cp j1.cpt | grep step

# Continue the simulation using the input file, the number of remaining steps (200,000 - 47,200 = 152,800) and the checkpoint.
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -noappend -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps 152800 -maxh 0.016 -cpi j1.cpt

# Files generated after the second chunk (with j1.cpt and j1_prev.cpt updated) and uploaded to cloud storage:
j1.cpt
j1_prev.cpt
j1.part0002.edr
j1.part0002.log
j1.part0002.trr

# The same logic applies to next chunks until all 200,000 steps are completed.
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -noappend -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps 105600 -maxh 0.016 -cpi j1.cpt
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -noappend -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps  58700 -maxh 0.016 -cpi j1.cpt
gmx mdrun -nb gpu -pme gpu -bonded gpu -update gpu -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 8 -pin on -pinstride 1 -noappend -s j1.tpr -deffnm j1 -nsteps  11800 -maxh 0.016 -cpi j1.cpt
```

Here are the input, checkpoint and output files generated by the adapted workflow:

Please refer to [the example code](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/main_basic.py) that
implements the workflow described above. It is intended to run on your local machine, without any optimizations for
SaladCloud, and supports simulation interruption and resumption. To use it, you’ll need access to a Cloudflare R2 or
other S3-compatible cloud storage bucket and must specify the path of input and output files.

## Running GROMACS on SaladCloud

### Code Optimizations

To run GROMACS efficiently on SaladCloud, several additional code optimizations are recommended:

- Use chunked and parallel data transfers to maximize throughput when uploading or downloading large files between Salad
  nodes and cloud storage.

- Introduce a dedicated uploader thread with task queue to offload upload operations from the main thread, ensuring that
  simulation execution remains unblocked.

- Add error handling, monitoring, and logging to improve reliability, enhance visibility, and simplify troubleshooting.

Please refer to [the example code](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/main_salad.py) for
more implementation details.

The code also generates [a task log file](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/history.txt)
upon simulation completion, alongside the standard output files. This log contains detailed runtime statistics, which
can be analyzed using
[salad_analysis.py](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/salad_analysis.py) to produce a
summary report.

### Dockerfile Configuration

[The provided Dockerfile](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/Dockerfile) creates a
containerized environment by using the miniconda official image, then installing essential utilities (VS Code Server
CLI), GROMACS 2024.5 and required dependencies. It copies the required Python code into the image and sets the default
command.

```Dockerfile
# Select a base image: https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:25.1.1-0

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl net-tools iputils-ping

# Optional: Install VS Code Server for remote debugging
RUN curl -Lk 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=cli-alpine-x64' -o vscode_cli.tar.gz && \
    tar -xf vscode_cli.tar.gz && \
    mv code /usr/local/bin/code && \
    rm vscode_cli.tar.gz

# Install GROMACS 2024.5，with CUDA and without MPI
# https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gromacs
# No GPU when building the image, so we use CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA to simulate CUDA during build
RUN CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="11.8" conda install -c conda-forge gromacs=2024.5=nompi_cuda_h5cb645a_0 -y

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install python-dotenv boto3 salad-cloud-sdk

WORKDIR /app
COPY main_basic.py helper.py main_salad.py salad_monitor.py /app/

CMD ["python", "main_salad.py"]

# The pre-built image:
# docker.io/saladtechnologies/mds:001-gromacs-srcg
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set before running a simulation. These variables will be passed to the
SRCG at creation time. For easy configuration and reuse, you can define them in a .env file located in the project
directory.

```bash .env
# Access to the Cloudflare R2:
CLOUDFLARE_ENDPOINT_URL=https://******.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
CLOUDFLARE_ID=******
CLOUDFLARE_KEY=******

# Task parameters: input, checkpoint and output files are stored in the BUCKET/PREFIX/FOLDER.
BUCKET=<BUCKET_NAME>
PREFIX=<PREFIX_NAME> # Optional
FOLDER=<FOLDER_NAME>
TPR_FILE=<***.tpr>
MAX_STEPS=10000000
SAVING_INTERVAL_HOURS=0.5 # 30 minutes

# If the main thread is unresponsive for the specified duration, the uploader thread triggers reallocation.
MAX_NO_RESPONSE_TIME=3600 # 1 hour

# This is optional and allows the SRCG to call the SaladCloud API internally to shut itself down once the simulation is complete.
# If these settings are not provided, the SRCG will continue running (sleep infinity) after completion, and you can log into the instance to perform additional tasks using VS Code or the terminal available through the SaladCloud Portal.
# SaladCloud will introduce a new mechanism that allows the SRCG to shut itself down internally, eliminating the need for the SaladCloud Python SDK and API access.
SALAD_API_KEY=salad_cloud_user_******
ORGANIZATION_NAME=******
PROJECT_NAME=******
CONTAINER_GROUP_NAME=******

# Optional, telling the SRCG when it was created
# TASK_CREATION_TIME=2025-06-18 10:10:10
```

### Local Run

If you have access to a local GPU environment, you can perform a test of the image before running it on SaladCloud. Use
`docker compose` to start the container defined in
[docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/docker-compose.yaml). The command
automatically loads environment variables from the .env file in the same directory.

```bash
docker compose up
```

The input .tpr file should be uploaded to the cloud before starting the test.

### Deployment on SaladCloud

Run [salad_quotas.py](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/salad_quotas.py) to view detailed
information about your current quotas and available GPU types, and refer to
[salad_deploy.py](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/salad_deploy.py) for a deployment
example of an SRCG with the SaladCloud Python SDK to run a simulation task.

The [salad_monitor.py](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/salad_monitor.py) script monitors
the simulation progress by checking the files uploaded to cloud storage. It can also reset the test environment by
clearing the cloud folder while preserving the .tpr input file.

To debug and perform manual tasks, follow [this guide](/tutorials/vscode-remote-development#interactive-mode) to connect
to the SRCG using VS Code.

## Test Results

The input model for the test is [a huge virus protein](https://zenodo.org/records/3893789) with 1,066,628 atoms. The
test run 10,000,000 steps with a chunking interval of 30 minutes.

Here is the summary of
[the test run results](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/mds/blob/main/gromacs-srcg/history.txt) on SaladCloud:

```txt
SRCG Resource Type: 16 vCPUs, 24 GB RAM, RTX 4000-series GPUs
Task Creation Time: 2025-06-18 10:38:10
First Node Online: 2025-06-18 10:45:09 (7 minutes after task creation)
Total Task Duration: 1 day, 0:11:45
Efficient Runtime: 22:57:01
Non-Running time: 1:14:44
Runtime-to-Duration Ratio: 95%
Interruptions: 2 (the last one was shut down by the test code)
```

**The 75 minutes of non-running time includes:**

- 2 Interruptions: With a 30 minutes chunking interval, the interruptions may result in 30 minutes of lost compute time
  (estimated as N x Chunking Interval / 2). This lost time is not included in the efficient runtime, and can be reduced
  by using smaller chunking intervals.
- 3 Node allocation/reallocations. This includes image pulling and environment setup, which are not charged by
  SaladCloud.

Here are the detailed statistics of each node run:

| ID                                   | GPU                        | Start               | End                 | Duration | Chunks | Steps     | Steps/Second     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| c599288a-9974-3858-b1eb-1e8b2e8aa9ab | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti | 2025-06-18 10:45:09 | 2025-06-19 00:11:28 | 13:26:19 | 27     | 3,717,000 | 76.83 steps/sec  |
| e138daef-c41c-e050-ba2d-889b7b9a08fc | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090    | 2025-06-19 00:46:07 | 2025-06-19 01:16:05 | 0:29:58  | 1      | 385,400   | 214.35 steps/sec |
| e3b930f7-637d-6e57-a67b-3bb9563a2796 | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090    | 2025-06-19 01:49:11 | 2025-06-19 10:49:55 | 9:00:44  | 19     | 5,897,600 | 181.78 steps/sec |

The SRCG approach is easy to set up and works especially well for long-running simulations—where the longer the runtime,
the more negligible the non-runtime overhead becomes. However, when running a large number of simulation
tasks—particularly short ones—a job queue is essential to maintain efficiency and scalability.
