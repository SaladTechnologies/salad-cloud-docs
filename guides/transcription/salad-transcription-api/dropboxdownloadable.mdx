_Last Updated: October 09, 2024_

To make a Dropbox file link directly downloadable, you need to modify the URL slightly. Here’s how to do it:

### Step 1: Get the Shareable Link

1. Go to Dropbox and locate the file you want to share.
2. Right-click on the file and select “Share.”
3. In the sharing window, click “Copy link” to get the shareable link.

### Step 2: Modify the Link for Direct Download

- The default Dropbox shareable link will look something like this:

  ```ruby
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/yourfileid/filename?dl=0

  ```

- To make this link directly downloadable, change the `dl=0` at the end of the URL to `dl=1`. The modified link will
  look like this:
  ```ruby
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/yourfileid/filename?dl=1
  ```

### What This Does:

```bash
bashCopy code
https://www.dropbox.com/s/abcd1234/yourfile.pdf?dl=1

```

- Changing `dl=0` to `dl=1` tells Dropbox to serve the file as a direct download, bypassing the preview page.

You can now share this modified link, and anyone who clicks on it will be prompted to download the file directly.
