title: 'Migrating from Deepgram Transcription'
---

_Last Updated: March 14, 2025_

Migrating from Deepgram's Nova-2 and Nova-3 Transcription to Salad Transcription API will require you to replace your
Deepgram Python functions with Salad compatible ones. Whilst we do not offer an SDK, we do have example Python functions
that you can use in replacement.

## 1. Get your Salad API Key.

    - Open up https://portal.salad.com and sign up/log into your account.
    - Navigate to your profile at the top right, and select API Access. Here you can find your API Key.

## 2. Updating job creation API calls.

The Salad Transcription API uses a Job Queue system for processing transcription requests, rather than a Python function
that returns the data like Deepgram. With Salad Transcription API, you'll use two steps. Submit the job, and then
request the results.

### Deepgram Transcription

Your existing Python code for Deepgram Transcription should look something like this:

```Python
import os
import logging
from deepgram.utils import verboselogs

from deepgram import (
    DeepgramClient,
    PrerecordedOptions,
)

AUDIO_URL = {
    "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3"
}

def main():
    try:
        deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient()

        options: PrerecordedOptions = PrerecordedOptions(
            model="nova-3",
            smart_format=True,
        )
        response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_url(AUDIO_URL, options)
        print(f"response: {response}\n\n")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### Salad Transcription API Equivalent

When using Salad Transcription API, you’ll update that job creation function to instead look like this:

```Python
import requests

def salad_transcribe(file, Salad-Api-Key):

    url = "https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"

    payload = {
        "input": {
       	    "url": file,
       	    "language_code": "en",
       	    "return_as_file": False
        }
    }
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": Salad-Api-Key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response

Salad-Api-Key = "{Salad-Api-Key}"

file = "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3"

job = salad_transcribe(file)
print(job.text)
```

- For this code snippet, you'll need to insert your Salad Organization name into the API url field.
- You will also need to insert your Salad API Key we obtained earlier lower down in the code snippet.
- Put the URL to the file to be transcribed into the file string. Please note that Salad Transcription API can only
  process files up to 2.5 hours. Make sure the URL provided is to a direct download of the file. Header based security
  is not compatible with Salad Transcription API, so you'll need to use a signed URL like that offered by
  [Salad Simple Storage Service.](https://docs.salad.com/products/s4/salad-simple-storage-service#upload-a-file)
- The complete options for input parameters can be found in the
  [API Reference](/reference/transcribe/inference_endpoints/create-an-inference-endpoint-job#body-input)

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "inference_endpoint_name": "transcribe",
  "input": {
    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2"
  },
  "metadata": null,
  "organization_name": "example-corp",
  "status": "pending",
  "events": [],
  "create_time": "2025-01-016T19:00:00Z",
  "update_time": "2025-01-016T19:00:00Z"
}
```

## 3. Obtaining job results

In the response from submitting your job with the above step, you'll receive the Job ID which is required to obtain the
results of your transcription. The Job status and transcription results are combined into a single API call. With this
Python function, you'll check the status, and once the job is completed it will also retrieve the transcription results.

```Python
def get_result(job_id, Salad-Api-Key):
    url = "https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/" + job_id

    headers = {"Salad-Api-Key": Salad-Api-Key}

    response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

    return response

job_id = "{JOB_ID FROM BEFORE}"

Salad-Api-Key = "{Salad-Api-Key}"

result = get_result(job_id, Salad-Api-Key)
print(result.text)
```

- Make sure to again update the organization name above to your organization name.
- You will need to insert the Job ID that you obtained from the previous step as well.
- And again make sure to include your Salad API Key.

Once the status of your job has reached `succeeded`, the `output` object will include the URL to the completed
transcription via a directly downloadable URL.

```json
