title: 'How to Automatically Follow Sales Playbooks with Salad Transcription API'
---

_Last Updated: March 28, 2025_

By using our integrated custom LLM prompts, you can automatically follow a Sales Playbook from your transcribed meetings
and sales calls to help meet your KPIs. To use this, you just need to add the `custom_prompt` input parameter to your
transcription request.

## Custom input parameters

In this example, we'll use a Python script to transcribe an audio file and tell it to use the `custom_prompt` input
parameter to answer questions in our mock playbook. We'll use the following input parameters:

```python
payload = {"input": {
        "custom_prompt": "The following is a sales call transcription. Follow the playbook and answer the questions. If there are no answers, say 'No answer'. Question 1: Did the sales person get the customers name? Question 2: Did the sales person correctly understand the customers requirements? Question 3: Did the sales person ask for the customer's pain point with their existing providor? Question 4: How well and precisely did the sales person answer questions posed by the customer? Question 5: Did the sales person ask the customer how the call went?",
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
```

## Python script

We're going to create a file and name it `playbook.py`. We're then going to use the above parameters in the following
Python script:

```python
import requests
import time

audio_file_url = "url/to/audio/file.mp3" # replace with your audio file URL

salad_api_key = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY" # replace with your Salad API key
organization_name = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME" #Â replace with your organization name

payload = {"input": {
        "custom_prompt": "The following is a sales call transcription. Follow the playbook and answer the questions. If there are no answers, say 'No answer'. Question 1: Did the sales person get the customers name? Question 2: Did the sales person correctly understand the customers requirements? Question 3: Did the sales person ask for the customer's pain point with their existing providor? Question 4: How well and precisely did the sales person answer questions posed by the customer? Question 5: Did the sales person ask the customer how the call went?",
        "url": audio_file_url,
        "diarization": True,
        "language_code": "en",
        "return_as_file": False
    }}
headers = {
    "Salad-Api-Key": salad_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}


url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

response = response.json()
job_id=response["id"]
print (f'Job ID: {job_id}')

while True:
  time.sleep(5)
  try:
      result = requests.get(f"{url}/{job_id}", headers=headers)
      result = result.json()
      if result["status"] == "created" or result["status"] == "pending" or result["status"] == "started" or result["status"] == "running":
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
      elif result["status"] == "failed":
          print(f'Job failed')
          break
      elif result["output"]:
          print(result["output"]["llm_result"])
          break
      else:
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
  except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error retrieving transcription result: {e}')
        break
```

- Make sure to replace `url/to/audio/file.mp3` with the URL of your audio file.
- Replace `YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY` with
  [your Salad API key](products/sce/getting-started/quickstart-api#step-1-obtain-your-api-key).
- Replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
- Modify the questions in the `custom_prompt` parameter to match your playbook.
- Run the script using with `python playbook.py`.

In this script, we're telling the LLM to answer our questions and fill in the sales playbook. It will be returned in the
`llm_result` field of the response. We're then printing the result of this field to the console. Your console will look
something like this once it finishes:

### Output
