title: 'How to Transcribe YouTube Videos with Salad Transcription API'
---

YouTube URLs are not natively downloadable, which can be a challenge when working with the Salad Transcription API,
which requires downloadable audio links. However, you can extract audio from YouTube videos, upload it to
[Salad Simple Storage Service](/products/s4/salad-simple-storage-service/) free of charge, and use the resulting link
with the API.

This guide will walk you through the process, starting with handling a single YouTube URL and then scaling to batch
processing multiple URLs.

---

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Python Installed**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher.
2. **Libraries Installed**: Use the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp requests
   ```
3. **FFmpeg Installed**: FFmpeg is needed by yt-dlp for processing audio:
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
   - **MacOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Windows**: [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system PATH.
4. **Salad API Key**: Ensure you have a valid Salad API key.

---

### **Step 1: Import Libraries**

To start, import the required Python libraries:

```python

# For extracting audio from YouTube
from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

# For handling HTTP requests and file paths
import requests
from pathlib import Path
import os

# For working with JSON files (batch processing).
import json
```

### **Step 2: Define Functions**

**1. Download Audio from YouTube**

This function downloads the best-quality audio from a YouTube video:

```python
def download_audio_from_youtube(video_url, output_format="mp3"):
    """
    Downloads audio from a YouTube video in the specified format.

    Args:
        video_url (str): The URL of the YouTube video.
        output_format (str): Desired audio format (default: "mp3").

    Returns:
        str: The filename of the downloaded audio file.
    """
    try:
        ydl_opts = {
            'format': 'bestaudio/best',
            'postprocessors': [{
                'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
                'preferredcodec': output_format,
                'preferredquality': '192',
            }],
            'outtmpl': '%(id)s.%(ext)s',
        }
        with YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
            info = ydl.extract_info(video_url, download=True)
            return f"{info['id']}.{output_format}"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading audio: {e}")
        return None

```

**2. Upload Audio to Salad Storage**

This function uploads the audio file to Salad Storage and generates a presigned URL:

```python
def upload_to_salad_storage(audio_file_path, salad_api_key, organization_name, mime_type="audio/mpeg"):
    """
    Uploads an audio file to Salad Storage and generates a signed access URL.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        salad_api_key (str): Salad API key for authentication.
        organization_name (str): Name of the Salad organization.
        mime_type (str): MIME type of the file (default: "audio/mpeg").

    Returns:
        str: The signed URL for the uploaded file.
    """
    try:
      # Generate the upload URL
      file_name = f"audio/{Path(audio_file_path).name}"
      upload_url = f"https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/{organization_name}/files/{file_name}"

      # Prepare headers for authentication
      headers = {"Salad-Api-Key": salad_api_key}

      # Prepare data for the upload
      data = {
          "mimeType": mime_type,
          "sign": "true",  # Request a signed URL
          "signatureExp": 3 * 24 * 60 * 60  # 3 days in seconds
      }

      # Prepare the file to be uploaded
      with open(audio_file_path, "rb") as f:
          files = {"file": (Path(audio_file_path).name, f)}
          response = requests.put(upload_url, headers=headers, data=data, files=files)
          response.raise_for_status()

      # Extract and return the signed URL
      signed_url = response.json().get("url")
      if not signed_url:
          raise ValueError("Signed URL not returned by the API.")
      return signed_url

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error uploading to Salad storage: {e}")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"API response error: {ve}")
    return None

```

### **Step 3: Define Variables**

Set the variables required for the process:

```python
# Salad Storage credentials
SALAD_API_KEY = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Salad API key
ORGANIZATION_NAME = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME"  # Replace with your organization name

# YouTube URL to process
YOUTUBE_URL = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TXKy-Efu3Q"  # Replace with your YouTube video URL

```

### **Step 4: Process a Single URL**

Use the functions to process a single YouTube URL:

```python
print("Processing single YouTube URL...")
audio_path = download_audio_from_youtube(YOUTUBE_URL)  # Step 1: Download audio
print(f"Downloaded audio to: {audio_path}")

storage_url = upload_to_salad_storage(audio_path, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME)  # Step 2: Upload to Salad Storage
print(f"Uploaded successfully. Storage URL: {storage_url}")
# Clean up temporary files
os.remove(audio_path)
```

Signed Salad Storage URL will be printed and stored under `storage_url`.

### **Step 5: Batch Process Multiple URLs**

To process multiple YouTube URLs, use the following script:

```python
# List of YouTube URLs
YOUTUBE_URLS = [
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TXKy-Efu3Q",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XywRe0c0bGU",
]

# Dictionary to store mappings of YouTube URLs to Salad Storage links
url_mappings = {}

for url in YOUTUBE_URLS:
    try:
        print(f"Processing: {url}")
        audio_path = download_audio_from_youtube(url)  # Step 1: Download audio
        storage_url = upload_to_salad_storage(audio_path, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME)  # Step 2: Upload audio
        url_mappings[url] = storage_url
        Path(audio_path).unlink()  # Clean up local file
        print(f"Processed successfully: {url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to process {url}: {e}")

# Save mappings to a JSON file
with open("url_mappings.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(url_mappings, f, indent=4)

print("Batch processing complete. URL mappings saved to url_mappings.json.")

```

Expected Output: A url_mappings.json file is generated with the mappings:

```json
{
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TXKy-Efu3Q": "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/....mp3",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XywRe0c0bGU": "https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME/files/audio/...mp3"
}
```

### **Step 6: Send Prepared URLs to the Salad Transcription API**

Once the audio files are uploaded to Salad Storage and you have the corresponding signed URLs, the final step is to send
these URLs to the Salad Transcription API for processing.

You can find detailed instructions on how to send requests a to the Salad Transcription API in the official
documentation:

[Salad Transcription API Documentation](/guides/transcription/salad-transcription-api/transcription-quick-start)

Below, we provide a function to send a transcription request to the API and retrieve the `job_id`.

**Function to Send a Transcription Request**

This function sends a transcription request to the Salad Transcription API for a single URL:

```python
import requests

def send_transcription_request(audio_url, organization_name, salad_key, language_code="en", input_params=None):
    """
    Sends a transcription request to the Salad Transcription API with dynamic input parameters.

    Args:
        audio_url (str): The signed Salad Storage URL for the audio file.
        api_endpoint (str): The Salad Transcription API endpoint.
        salad_key (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        language_code (str): The language of the audio file (default: "en").
        input_params (dict): Additional input parameters to include in the request.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API, including the job ID.
    """
    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
    # Prepare the input dictionary, appending the audio URL and language code
    input_data = input_params.copy() if input_params else {}
    input_data["url"] = audio_url
    input_data["language_code"] = language_code

    # Request body
    data = {
        "input": input_data
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

```

**Usage Example**

Here is how you can use the function to submit a transcription request: All the parameters needed for the function were
already defined in the previous steps.

```python
# Define dynamic input parameters. Discover more about available parameters in the official documentation.
# Example:
input_parameters = {
    "sentence_level_timestamps": False,
    "diarization": False,
}

# Send the transcription request
try:
    response = send_transcription_request(
        audio_url=uploaded_url,
        organization_name=organization_name,
        salad_key=salad_api_key,
        language_code="en",  # Specify the language code if needed
        input_params=input_parameters
    )
    print(f"Transcription request submitted successfully. Job ID: {response['id']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error sending transcription request: {e}")

```

**Expected Output**

If the request is successful, the API will return a job_id and our function will print it out:

```text
Transcription request submitted successfully. Job ID: 6ea78b03-6ca4-4aeb-9136-4442fe8f49b2
```

The job_id is a unique identifier for the transcription job. You can use it later to check the job status or retrieve
the final result.

**Note** If you have multiple audio files to process, you can loop through the list of URLs and call this function for
each one to retrieve a list of job_ids.

### **Step 7: Retrieve the Transcription Result**

If you did not specify a webhook to receive the result, you can manually retrieve the transcription result using the
job_id returned in Step 6.

**Function to Retrieve Transcription Results**

This function retrieves the result of a transcription job from the Salad Transcription API:

```python
def get_transcription_result(job_id, salad_key, organization_name):
    """
    Retrieves the transcription result from the Salad Transcription API for a given job ID.

    Args:
        job_id (str): The unique identifier of the transcription job.
        salad_key (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        organization_name (str): Name of the Salad organization.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API containing the job status and transcription result.
    """
    # Construct the Salad API endpoint for retrieving job results
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job_id}"

    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

```

**Usage Example**

Here is how to use the function to retrieve the result:

```python

# Retrieve the transcription result
try:
    result = get_transcription_result(
        job_id=response["id"],
        salad_key=salad_api_key,
        organization_name=organization_name
    )
    if result['output']:
        print(f"Transcription Result: {result['output']}")
    else:
        print(f"Current job status is {result['status']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving transcription result: {e}")

```

**Expected Output**

If the job is still processing:

```text
Current job status is processing
```

If the job is completed:

```text
Transcription Result: {'text': " if you're an ai company you are paying too much for the cloud high-end gpus like

```

**Note**

- **Check the Status**: If the job is still processing, you will need to retry later. Ensure you handle the status in
  the response appropriately.

- **Polling Frequency**: Avoid excessive polling. Query the API at reasonable intervals (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) to
  check if the job is completed.
