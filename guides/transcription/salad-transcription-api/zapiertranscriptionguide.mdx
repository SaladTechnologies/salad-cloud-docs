title: 'Zapier Transcription Guide'

_Last Updated: October 10, 2024_

This guide will show you how to use Zapier to automate transcription with Salad, streamlining the request and response
process for efficient audio file handling. This workflow will consist of two Zaps:

1. **Request Zap**: This Zap will trigger when a Google Form (or any other app of your choice) is submitted, sending a
   transcription request to the SaladCloud service.
2. **Response Zap**: This Zap will catch the response from the SaladCloud service and send the transcription result via
   email (use any app you like).

# **Step 1 Create the response Zap**

1. **Login to Zapier**: Go to [Zapier.com](https://zapier.com) and log in to your account.
2. **Create a New Zap**: On the home page, click the "Create" button and select "Zaps".

# **Step 2 Set Up the Catch Hook Trigger**

We will start with the response Zap to create a catch webhook URL.

1. **Choose Webhooks by Zapier**: Click on the trigger and find "Webhooks by Zapier.
   1. Note that Webhooks are only available to Zapier Pro customers.
2. **Select Event**: Choose "Catch Hook"

3. **Copy Webhook URL**: Zapier will generate a unique webhook URL. Copy this URL for use in the Request Zap.

# **Step 3 Create the Response Zap**

Create a New Zap for API Call Automation

1. **Return to Home Page**: Go back to the Zapier home page.
2. **Create a New Zap**: Click on the "Create" button and select "Zaps".
3. **Name Your Zap**: For clarity, name this Zap something like "Request".
4. **Set Up the Trigger**
   1. Before setting up the Zaps, we created a Google Form with a single field. This field will collect the URL of the
      audio file to be transcribed.
5. **Choose Google Forms**: Click on the trigger and find "Google Forms".
6. **Select Trigger Event**: Choose "New Form Response".
7. **Connect Your Account**: Link your Google account and select the form you created with the "File link" field.
8. **Test Trigger**: Test the trigger to ensure Zapier can retrieve form responses.
9. **Set Up the Webhook Action**.
10. **Choose Webhooks by Zapier**: Search for and select "Webhooks by Zapier".
11. **Select Action Event**: Choose "Custom Request".
12. **Configure the Action:**
    1. Fill in the required fields:
       1. **Method**: Select "POST" from the dropdown.
       2. **URL**: Enter your SaladCloud API endpoint URL. For example:
          https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{your_organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs.
          Replace {your_organization_name} with the name of your organization in Salad.
       3. **Data**: In the "Data" field, configure it as follows:
          1. **Copy and paste the following json:**

```
{
  "input": {
    "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
    "language_code": "en",
    "word_level_timestamps": true,
    "diarization": true,
    "srt": true
  },
  "webhook": "{your_webhook_url}",
  "metadata": {
    "my-job-id": 1234
  }
}

```

- _For "url": Click inside the quotation marks and select "File link" from the dropdown to insert the data from the
  Google Form._
- _For "webhook": Paste the webhook URL you copied from the Response Zap._

1. **Headers:**

   1. Under “Headers" enter the following key-value pairs:

      **Key**: Salad-Api-Key, Value: (your SaladCloud API key)

      **Key**: Content-Type, Value: application/json

2. Here is the full JSON :

```
{
 "input": {
    "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
    "language_code": "en",
    "word_level_timestamps": false,
    "diarization": false,
    "srt": false
    },
    "metadata": {
        "my-job-id": 1234
    }
}

```

13. **Test and save this zap.**

# **Step 4 Create an Action Step in Your "Response" Zap**

1. **Create an Action Step**: In your "Response" Zap, click on "Action" to add a new action step.
2. **Choose an App**: Select any app you want to use for the action. In our case, we will choose "Email by Zapier".
3. **Configure the Email**:
   1. **To**: Enter the recipient's email address where you want to send the transcription result.
   2. **Subject**: Enter a subject for the email, such as "Transcription Result".
   3. **Body**: You will need to trigger your request by submitting your Google Form. The Catch Hook needs at least one
      request to know the structure of your data. After submitting the form, go back to the email setup and pick fields
      from “Insert Data“ that you want to see in the body of your email.
      1. Click on "Insert Data" and choose the fields you want to include in your email body. In our case, we chose
         "Data Output Text" from the webhook trigger data.
4. **Test Action**: Send a test email to ensure everything is set up correctly

# **Final Step Complete the Setup**

You're all set! Each time you submit your Google Form, the transcription will start and an email with the result will be
sent upon completion.

_Here's a summary of the final Step_

1. **Submit the Google Form**: When you submit the form with the audio file link, it triggers the Request Zap, which
   sends the transcription request to the SaladCloud service.
2. **Transcription Process**: The SaladCloud service processes the transcription request.
3. **Receive Transcription Result**: The Response Zap catches the result from the SaladCloud service.
4. **Send Email with Result**: The Response Zap then sends an email with the transcription result to the specified
   recipient.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an automated audio transcription workflow using Google Forms, Zapier, and
SaladCloud. Note that transcripts will be available for up to 24.
