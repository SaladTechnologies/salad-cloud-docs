title: 'How to Transcribe a local file using S4 and Salad Transcription API'
---

*Last Updated: March 05, 2025*


## Introduction

By following this guide, you'll learn how to transcribe a file you have locally on your PC by uploading it to S4 (Salad
Simple Storage Service), transcribing using Salad Transcription API, and saving the transcription to a file.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Python Installed**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher. _ Python 3.11.6 was used for the creation of this script_
2. **Salad API Key**: Ensure you have a valid [Salad API key](/reference/api-usage#get-your-saladcloud-api-key).

## Uploading and Transcribing

Now, we'll start by uploading the file to the S4 service and generating a signed access URL to keep the data secure.
Next, we'll send that file to the Salad Transcription API, and after that we will save the results to a local file in
the same directory as the audio file.

### Uploading to S4

```Python
import requests
from pathlib import Path
import os
import json
import time
import sys

def upload_to_salad_storage(audio_file_path, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME, mime_type="audio/mpeg"):
    """
    Uploads an audio file to Salad Storage and generates a signed access URL.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): Path to the audio file.
        SALAD_API_KEY (str): Salad API key for authentication.
        ORGANIZATION_NAME (str): Name of the Salad organization.
        mime_type (str): MIME type of the file (default: "audio/mpeg").

    Returns:
        str: The signed URL for the uploaded file.
    """
    try:
      # Generate the upload URL
      file_name = f"audio/{Path(audio_file_path).name}"
      upload_url = f"https://storage-api.salad.com/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/files/{file_name}"

      # Prepare headers for authentication
      headers = {"Salad-Api-Key": SALAD_API_KEY}

      # Prepare data for the upload
      data = {
          "mimeType": mime_type,
          "sign": "true",  # Request a signed URL
          "signatureExp": 3 * 24 * 60 * 60  # 3 days in seconds
      }

      # Prepare the file to be uploaded
      with open(audio_file_path, "rb") as f:
          files = {"file": (Path(audio_file_path).name, f)}
          response = requests.put(upload_url, headers=headers, data=data, files=files)
          response.raise_for_status()

      # Extract and return the signed URL
      signed_url = response.json().get("url")
      if not signed_url:
          raise ValueError("Signed URL not returned by the API.")
      return signed_url

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error uploading to Salad storage: {e}")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"API response error: {ve}")
    return None

# Salad Storage credentials
SALAD_API_KEY = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Salad API key
ORGANIZATION_NAME = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME"  # Replace with your organization name

# audio file to process
audio_file_path = "path/to/your/audio.mp3"  # Replace with the path to the local audio file you want to upload

storage_url = upload_to_salad_storage(audio_file_path, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME)  # Uploads to Salad Storage
print(f"Uploaded successfully. Storage URL: {storage_url}")
```

If you were to run your script now, it would upload your audio to S4 and return a signed URL to access the file. Next,
we'll send that URL to Salad Transcription API to transcribe.

### Transcribing the Audio

```Python
import requests

def send_transcription_request(audio_url, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SALAD_API_KEY, language_code="en", input_params=None):
    """
    Sends a transcription request to the Salad Transcription API with dynamic input parameters.

    Args:
        audio_url (str): The signed Salad Storage URL for the audio file.
        ORGANIZATION_NAME (str): The name of the organization.
        SALAD_API_KEY (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        language_code (str): The language of the audio file (default: "en").
        input_params (dict): Additional input parameters to include in the request.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API, including the job ID.
    """
    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": SALAD_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
    # Prepare the input dictionary, appending the audio URL and language code
    input_data = input_params.copy() if input_params else {}
    input_data["url"] = audio_url
    input_data["language_code"] = language_code

    # Request body
    data = {
        "input": input_data
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

# Define dynamic input parameters. Learn about all of the available input parameters in the Salad Transcription API documentation
# Example:
input_parameters = {
    "sentence_level_timestamps": False,
    "diarization": False,
}

SALAD_API_KEY = "YOUR_SALAD_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Salad API key
ORGANIZATION_NAME = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME"  # Replace with your organization name

storage_url = "your/signed/storage/url"  # Replace with the signed URL returned from the previous step

# Send the transcription request
try:
    response = send_transcription_request(
        audio_url=storage_url,
        ORGANIZATION_NAME=ORGANIZATION_NAME,
        SALAD_API_KEY=SALAD_API_KEY,
        language_code="en",  # Specify the language code if needed
        input_params=input_parameters
    )
    print(f"Transcription request submitted successfully. Job ID: {response['id']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error sending transcription request: {e}")
```

If you were to run your script now, it would send the transcription request using the signed S4 URL to the Salad
Transcription API and return the job ID. Next, we'll save the transcription to a file.

### Saving the Transcription to a File

```Python
def get_transcription_result(job_id, SALAD_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_NAME):
    """
    Retrieves the transcription result from the Salad Transcription API for a given job ID.

    Args:
        job_id (str): The unique identifier of the transcription job.
        SALAD_API_KEY (str): The Salad API key for authentication.
        ORGANIZATION_NAME (str): Name of the Salad organization.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the API containing the job status and transcription result.
    """
    # Construct the Salad API endpoint for retrieving job results
    api_endpoint = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job_id}"

    # Set headers
    headers = {
        "Salad-Api-Key": SALAD_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "accept": "application/json",
    }

    # Send the request
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Extract and return the response
    return response.json()

while True:
  # Retrieve the transcription result
  time.sleep(5) # Adjust this value if needed, depending on whether your transcription is long or short.
  try:
      result = get_transcription_result(
          job_id=response["id"],
          SALAD_API_KEY=SALAD_API_KEY,
          ORGANIZATION_NAME=ORGANIZATION_NAME
      )
      if result["output"]:
          with open("transcription_result.txt", "w") as f:
              text = str(result["output"]["text"])
              f.write(text)
          print(f'Transcription Result: {result["output"]}')
          with open('output.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(result, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
          break
      else:
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
  except Exception as e:
      if result["status"] in ["created", "started", "running", "failed"]:
          print(f'Current job status is {result["status"]}')
      else: print(f'Error retrieving transcription result: {e}')
```

If you were to run your script now with this added, it would retrieve the transcription result from the Salad
Transcription API and save it to a file named `transcription_result.txt` in the directory you run the script if
complete. It will also print the transcription result to the console. If the job is still processing, it will print the
current job status.

A JSON file will also be logged containing the entire output of the transcription API response to the same directory
named `output.json`.
