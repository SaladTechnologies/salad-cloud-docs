**_Does Salad Transcription have a web or app-based mobile experience?_**

No, Salad Transcription is an API product. Learn more about our API documentation,
[here](/guides/transcription/salad-transcription-api/transcription-quick-start.mdx).

**_Can I use more transcription hours than I bought codes for from AppSumo?_**

Yes, just add your credit card or get in touch with our support team (cloud@salad.com) if you have high volume needs.

**_How does Salad determine a transcription hour?_**

Salad calculates the number of hours based on the duration of your media, which is measured at the minute level.

Ex. A 12:34-minute video is calculated as (12\*60+34)/3600, which is 0.21 of an hour.

**_How would you suggest I use the service if Iâ€™m not familiar with how APIs work?_**

and follow the instructions provided. Users can try Transcription services in the
[Salad Portal](https://cloud-support.helpscoutdocs.com/article/425-how-to-try-transcription-services-in-the-salad-portal)
if they are unfamiliar with using an API.

**_Can I use the hours I purchase with AppSumo to power my own transcription service that I sell to my customers?_**

No, the AppSumo deal does not allow for the direct re-selling of transcription services. You can, however, power your
transcription capabilities, which are part of your own SaaS service, as long as it is not reselling Salad Transcription.

**_Does SaladCloud transcribe my media verbatim?_**

No, we do not offer verbatim capability. Word repetitions and other small errors are automatically corrected.

**_Is there a file size limit for transcription services?_**

Salad Transcription supports up to 3GB media files. Media files that are longer than 2.5 hours in duration will need to
be split. If you you require support for larger files, contact our
[sales team](https://meetings.hubspot.com/derick-thompson1/salad-managed-ai-services?uuid=e79046e3-c087-4332-8ed9-f9f262189cd0)
for a bespoke solution.

**_How long will it take transcribe my file?_**

Salad Transcription transcribes, on average, 8x faster than the duration of your media file. If diarization and time
codes are enabled, it drops to 4x faster as multiple passes are required.
