# Transcription API Features Guide

## Introduction

SaladCloud's Managed Transcription API offers a suite of powerful features to help you get the most out of your audio
and video content. This guide covers the key transcription parameters you can use to customize your transcription
outputs:

- **Transcription Output Options**:
  - `return_as_file`
  - `sentence_level_timestamps`
  - `word_level_timestamps`
- **Speaker Identification**:
  - `diarization`
  - `sentence_diarization`
- **Language Specification**:
  - `language_code`

By properly utilizing these parameters, you can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of your transcriptions.

## Transcription Parameters

### 1. `return_as_file`

#### Description

The `return_as_file` parameter allows you to receive your transcription output as a downloadable file URL. This is
particularly useful when dealing with large responses, as it helps avoid issues with response size limitations.

- **Default**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`

#### Usage

Set `"return_as_file": true` in your request to receive the transcription output as a file URL.

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
  "return_as_file": true
}
```

**Note:**

- If the response size exceeds **1 MB**, the output will automatically be returned as a file URL, even if return_as_file
  is set to false.
- This helps ensure reliable delivery of large transcription outputs.

### 2. sentence_level_timestamps

#### Description

Include timestamps at the sentence level in your transcription output.

- **Default**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`

#### Usage

Set `"sentence_level_timestamps": true` to include sentence-level timestamps. Set to false if you do not need them.

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
  "sentence_level_timestamps": true
}
```

**Output Format**

```json
"sentence_level_timestamps": [
    {
        "text": "Welcome to our presentation.",
        "timestamp": [
            29.98,
            29.98
        ],
        "start": 29.98,
        "end": 29.98,
    }
],
```

### 3. word_level_timestamps

#### Description

Include timestamps for each word in your transcription output.

- **Default**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`

#### Usage

Set `"word_level_timestamps": true` to include word-level timestamps.

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
  "word_level_timestamps": true
}
```

**Output Format** Word-level timestamps are provided in the word_segments array of the output.

```json
"word_segments": [
    {
        "word": "I",
        "start": 4.963,
        "end": 5.024,
        "score": 0.597,
    },
    {
        "word": "understand",
        "start": 5.084,
        "end": 5.548,
        "score": 0.471,
    },
    {
        "word": "something.",
        "start": 6.073,
        "end": 6.376,
        "score": 0.295,
    }
]
```

### 4. diarization

#### Description

Enable speaker separation and identification at the word level.

- **Default**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`

#### Usage

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
  "diarization": true
}
```

**Output Format** Speaker labels are included in both segments and word_segments when diarization is enabled.

```json
"word_segments": [
    {
        "word": "I",
        "start": 4.963,
        "end": 5.024,
        "score": 0.597,
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    },
    {
        "word": "understand",
        "start": 5.084,
        "end": 5.548,
        "score": 0.471,
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    },
    {
        "word": "something.",
        "start": 6.073,
        "end": 6.376,
        "score": 0.295,
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    }
]
```

### 5. sentence_diarization

#### Description

Include speaker information at the sentence level.

- **Default**: `false`
- **Type**: `boolean`

#### Usage

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
  "sentence_diarization": true
}
```

**Output Format** Speaker labels are included in the segments array when sentence_diarization is enabled.

```json
"sentence_level_timestamps": [
    {
        "text": "I understand something.",
        "timestamp": [
            4.64,
            6.82
        ],
        "start": 4.64,
        "end": 6.82,
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
    }
]
```

**Note:** If several speakers are identified in one sentence the most appearing one will be returned.

### 6. language_code

#### Description

Specify the language of the transcription to improve diarization and timestamps accuracy performance.

- **Default**: `en` (English)
- **Type**: `string`

#### Usage

Set `"language_code": language_code` to specify the language of the audio content.

**Example:**

```json
"input": {
  "url": "https://example.com/path/to/french_audio.mp3",
  "language_code": "fr"
}
```

**Supported Languages** Providing the correct language_code enhances transcription accuracy, especially for features
like diarization. Below is a list of supported language codes: "fr" (French), "de" (German), "es" (Spanish), "it"

**Note:** Mandatory for Diarization: When using diarization or sentence_diarization, specifying language_code is
required for better performance. Default Language: If language_code is not specified, it defaults to English ("en").
