If you encounter an error indicating that your audio file cannot be downloaded or the duration is missing, then you will
need to make sure your file is in a downloadable format. Follow these steps to ensure the file is publicly available and
downloadable.

1. **Make the file publicly available.**

Follow these steps to change the sharing settings of the file in Google Drive.

1. Open Google Drive:
   - Go to Google Drive.
   - Locate the File
   - Find the file you want to share
2. Open Sharing Settings:
   - Right-click on the file and select “Share”.
   - Alternatively, select the file and click the “Share” icon.
3. Change Link Sharing Settings:

   - In the sharing settings window, under “Get Link”, click on “Change to anyone with the link”.
   - Ensure the setting is “Anyone with the link” and the access level is set to “Viewer”.

4. **Make the URL downloadable.**

A downloadable URL initiates an automatic download when accessed via a browser. To convert a Google Drive link to a
downloadable link, you need to modify the URL format. Google Drive URLs typically look like this:

- https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing

To make this link directly downloadable, you should change it to

- https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID

Follow these steps to change the URL:

1. Identify the File ID: The FILE_ID is the part of the URL between /d/ and /view.
2. Construct the Downloadable URL: Replace the original URL with the new format.

- For example, if your original link is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J/view?usp=sharing The
  downloadable link would be:
  - https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J
- You can use this new URL with our transcription service.
