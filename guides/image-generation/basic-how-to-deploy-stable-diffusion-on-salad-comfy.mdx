_Last Updated: March 25, 2025_

# High Level

Regardless of your choice of stable diffusion inference server, models, or extensions, the basic process is as follows:

1. Get a docker image that runs your inference server
2. Copy any models and extensions you want into the docker image
3. Ensure the container is listening on an ipv6 address
4. Push the new image up to a container registry
5. Deploy the image as a SaladCloud container group

## Find a Docker Image

Find a docker image of ComfyUI. Here's one we've verified works on Salad:

**ComfyUI**

- Git Repo: [ComfyUI API](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api)
- Docker Image:
  [ghcr.io/saladtechnologies/comfyui-api:comfy0.3.27-torch2.6.0-cuda12.4-runtime](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api/pkgs/container/comfyui-api/versions)
- Model Directory: `/opt/ComfyUI/models`
- Custom Node Directory: `/opt/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`

Note that once deployed, you will be interacting with this as an API, and not through the browser user interface.

## Download Your Models and Extensions

Download any model files you plan to use. For our example, we’re going to use
[Dreamshaper 8](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper), available on [Civitai.com](http://Civitai.com)
([https://blog.salad.com/civitai-salad/](https://blog.salad.com/civitai-salad/))

## Create a Dockerfile

1.  Create a new file called `Dockerfile` and open it in your preferred text editor. At this point, your directory
    should look like this:

        ```
        .
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── dreamshaper_8.safetensors
        ```

2.  Save an API-Formatted workflow.json file in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This file will be used to warm up
    the server before starting it. You can generate this file by using the ComfyUI web interface to create a prompt, and
    then saving it in API format. See [below](#build-and-test-your-docker-image) for more details.

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── dreamshaper_8.safetensors
└── workflow_api_dreamshaper.json
```

3. Copy the following into your Dockerfile:

```docker
# We're going to use this verified comfyui image as a base
FROM ghcr.io/saladtechnologies/comfyui-api:comfy0.3.27-torch2.6.0-cuda12.4-runtime

# Now we copy our model into the image
ENV MODEL_DIR=/opt/ComfyUI/models
COPY dreamshaper_8.safetensors ${MODEL_DIR}/checkpoints/dreamshaper_8.safetensors

# We also need to copy the comfyui-api binary into the image, since ComfyUI
# is fully asynchronous by default, and has no convenient way to retrieve
# generated images.
ADD https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api/releases/download/1.8.2/comfyui-api .
RUN chmod +x comfyui-api

# OPTIONAL: Warmup the server by running a workflow before starting the server.
# The comfyui-api supports a warmup mode, where it will run a provided workflow before starting the server.
# This example assumes you have a workflow json file in the same directory as your Dockerfile.
COPY workflow_api_dreamshaper.json .
ENV WARMUP_PROMPT_FILE=workflow_api_dreamshaper.json

CMD ["./comfyui-api"]
```

Note that we are including a simple wrapper binary to the image to make it easier to retrieve generated images. ComfyUI
accepts prompts into a queue, and then eventually saves images to the local filesystem. This makes it difficult to use
in a stateless environment like Salad. This additional binary extends the ComfyUI `/prompt` API to allow either
receiving the generated images in the response body, or having complete images submitted to a provided webhook url.

## Build and Test Your Docker Image

1. Build the docker image. You should change the specified tag to suit your purpose. We've chosen to include the ComfyUI
   version (0.3.27), the API version (1.8.2) and the model name (dreamshaper8) in the tag.

```bash
docker build -t saladtechnologies/comfyui:comfy0.3.27-api1.8.2-dreamshaper8 .
```

2. (Recommended) Run the docker image locally to confirm it works as expected

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --gpus all -p 3000:3000 -p 8188:8188 --name comfyui \
   saladtechnologies/comfyui:comfy0.3.27-api1.8.2-dreamshaper8
   ```

   Using it here locally, we’re going to expose port 3000, which is required for the wrapper, and port 8188 that will
   let us access the web ui locally to make it easier to get the prompt object we need for the api.

   1. Go to [http://localhost:8188/](http://localhost:8188/) in your browser. You should see something like this:

      ![Default Comfy UI Interface](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-default-view.png)

   2. Click “Queue Prompt” to generate an image. Mine came out like this.

      ![Purple galaxy landscape inside a glass bottle on an outdoor table](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-image-1.png)

   3. Enable Dev Mode Options via the settings menu

      ![Click the gear to open the settings menu](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-settings-menu-1.png)

      ![Check the box labeled "Enable Dev mode Options"](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-settings-menu-2.png)

      You should see a new option in the menu, “Save (API Format)”:

      ![Notice the new button labeled "Save (API Format)"](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-settings-menu-3.png)

   4. Click the “Save (API Format)” button, and save it. You’ll get a file called “workflow_api.json” that contains
      everything ComfyUI needs to run that prompt again.

      ```json
      {
        "3": {
          "inputs": {
            "seed": 712610403220747,

        "6": {
          "inputs": {
            "text": "beautiful scenery nature glass bottle landscape, , purple galaxy bottle,",
            "clip": ["4", 1]
          },
          "class_type": "CLIPTextEncode",
          "_meta": {
            "title": "CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)"
          }
        },
        "7": {
          "inputs": {
            "text": "text, watermark",
            "clip": ["4", 1]
          },
          "class_type": "CLIPTextEncode",
          "_meta": {
            "title": "CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)"
          }
        },
        "8": {
          "inputs": {
            "samples": ["3", 0],
            "vae": ["4", 2]
          },
          "class_type": "VAEDecode",
          "_meta": {
            "title": "VAE Decode"
          }
        },
        "9": {
          "inputs": {
            "filename_prefix": "ComfyUI",
            "images": ["8", 0]
          },
          "class_type": "SaveImage",
          "_meta": {
            "title": "Save Image"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      You might notice this is kind of an unintuitive prompting format, but it does capture the nodes and connections
      used by ComfyUI. In my experience, the ComfyUI web ui is the best way to design your prompts, rather than trying
      to create a workflow json file like this from scratch.

   5. Submit the prompt to the wrapper API on port 3000, using Postman or any http request tool of your choice.

      ![Submitting the request via Postman](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-submit-prompt-1.png)

      You should submit a POST request to [`http://localhost:3000/prompt`](http://localhost:3000/prompt) with a JSON
      request body like this, where the value of “prompt” is that workflow json we created previously.

      ```json
      {
      	"prompt": { ... }
      }
      ```

   6. In a couple seconds you should receive a response like this:

      ```json
      {
         "id": "random-uuid",
         "prompt": { ... },
         "images": ["base64encodedimage"]
      }
      ```

   7. Decode the base64 encoded string into your image. You can do this in a free browser tool such as
      https://codebeautify.org/base64-to-image-converter

      ![Decoding the returned base64 image](/guides/image-generation/images/comfy-decoded-image-1.png)

      or using CLI tools like `jq` and `base64`. For this method, first save your response to a file called
      `response.json`. Then, run the following command:

      ```bash
      jq -r '.images[0]' response.json | base64 -d > image.png
      ```

## Push and Deploy Your Docker Image

1. Push your docker image up to docker hub (or the container registry of your choice.)

```bash
docker push saladtechnologies/comfyui:comfy0.3.27-api1.8.2-dreamshaper8
```

2. Deploy your image on Salad, using either the [Portal](https://portal.salad.com) or the
   [SaladCloud Public API](/reference/saladcloud-api/container_groups/create-a-container-group)

![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/salad-create-container-group.png)

We’re going to name our container group something obvious, and fill in the configuration form. Since this is a stable
diffusion 1.5 based model, we’re gong to give ourselves fairly modest hardware: 4 vCPUs, 12GB ram, an RTX 3060 Ti GPU,
and a reserved 1 GB of local storage for temporary storage of images as they are being generated. We’re going to use 3
replicas, to ensure coverage during node interruptions and reallocations.

![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-1.png)

![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-2.png)

![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-3.png)

Additionally, we will want to configure our startup and readiness probes (endpoints provided by the wrapper), and enable
the container gateway on port 3000. We’ve disabled authentication for this example, but you may want to enable it. If
you enable authentication, requests must be submitted with your SaladCloud API Key in the `Salad-Api-Key` header.

![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-4.png)

Click Deploy, and wait for the deployment to come up.

## Interact with Your Deployment

1. Wait for the deployment to be ready.

   1. First, SaladCloud pulls your container image into our own internal high-performance cache.

      ![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-5.png)

   2. Next, SaladCloud locates eligible nodes for your workload, based on the configuration you provided.

      ![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-6.png)

   3. Next, SaladCloud begins downloading the cached container image to the nodes that have been assigned to your
      workload.

      ![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-7.png)

      This step can take tens of minutes in some cases, depending on the size of the image, and the internet speed of
      the individual nodes. Note that our progress bars are only estimates, and do not necessarily reflect real-time
      download status. These slow cold starts, and the possibility of nodes being interrupted by their host without
      warning, are why we always want to provision multiple replicas.

   4. Eventually, you will see instances listed as “running”, with a green check in the “ready” column.

      ![Untitled](/guides/image-generation/images/deploy-comfy-8.png)

2. Submit your prompt to the provided Access Domain Name. You will get back a json response within a few seconds. See
   [above](#build-and-test-your-docker-image) for how to submit the request and process the response.
