# Managing Long-Running Tasks on SaladCloud with SQS

Managing long running tasks, such as molecular simulations, dreambooth training, and llm finetuning, presents unique
challenges on SaladCloud, due primarily to the interruptible nature of nodes. At the core of all solutions to this
problem are a job queue, and progress checkpoints. The job queue is responsible for distributing tasks to workers, and
detecting when a worker has been interrupted. Workloads should save checkpoints of their progress and upload it to cloud
storage, so that they can be resumed from the last checkpoint in the event of an interruption. Workers should also
upload completed artifacts to cloud storage.

We will be using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) hosted on [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/) as our job
queue, and [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/), an S3-compatible object storage
service, as our cloud storage. We prefer R2 to AWS S3 for many SaladCloud workloads, because R2 does not charge for
egress data, and SaladCloud's distributed nodes are not in datacenters, and therefore may incur egress fees from other
providers. Instrumenting your code to use S3-compatible storage will make it easier to switch storage providers in the
future if you choose to do so.

For this guide, we will build an application that slowly calculates a sum for _n_ steps, sleeping for 30 seconds between
steps to simulate work. We will set up a job queue and related resources, a storage bucket, a checkpoint saving system,
and a simple auto-scaling mechanism.

You will need a CloudAMQP account, and a Cloudflare account to follow this guide.
