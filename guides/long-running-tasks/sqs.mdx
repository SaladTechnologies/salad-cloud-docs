title: 'SQS and SaladCloud'
description: 'Managing Long-Running Tasks on SaladCloud with SQS'
---

Managing long running tasks, such as molecular simulations, dreambooth training, and llm finetuning, presents unique
challenges on SaladCloud, due primarily to the interruptible nature of nodes. At the core of all solutions to this
problem are a job queue, and progress checkpoints. The job queue is responsible for distributing tasks to workers, and
detecting when a worker has been interrupted. Workloads should save checkpoints of their progress and upload it to cloud
storage, so that they can be resumed from the last checkpoint in the event of an interruption.

In this guide, we will be using [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) as our job queue, and
[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/), an S3-compatible object storage service, as
our cloud storage. We prefer R2 to AWS S3 for many SaladCloud workloads, because R2 does not charge egress, and
SaladCloud's distributed nodes are not in datacenters, and therefore may incur egress fees from other providers.
Instrumenting your code to use S3-compatible storage will make it easier to switch storage providers in the future if
you choose to do so.
