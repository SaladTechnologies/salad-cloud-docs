description: "Start integrating directly with Salad's robust API"
---

The Salad API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

Each API request is authenticated with an API access token that can be accessed via the Web Portal. Each user has a unique API token that grants API access to any Organization, Project, or Container group that the user has access to. If you need to get a new API Token, you are able to refresh API tokens directly from the Web Portal.

## Get your SaladCloud API Key

Navigate to the `API Access` section under the account drop down

Your account's API is what you need to utilize all Salad APIs.

## Refreshing API Keys

If you need to update your API key for any reason, you can refresh the API key from the `API Access` page.

<Note>
  When you refresh an API token, the previous token is immediately invalidated
  and will not longer grant API access.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

Salad's servers enforce rate limits to ensure our APIs are responsive as we grow. The rate limit is tied to an individual API key and set to 240 requests per minute. If your team would like a higher rate limit, please reach out to our team.

## Errors

Salad uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Salad's servers (these are rare).

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
