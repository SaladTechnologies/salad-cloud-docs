## API Reference

### Example cURL Post Transcript
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{my-organization}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs \
   -H "Salad-Api-Key: {your-api-key}" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
      "input": {
         "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3",
         "language_code": "en",
         "sentence_level_timestamps": "true"
         "word_level_timestamps": false,
         "diarization": false,
         "srt": false,
         "translate": "to_eng"
      },
    "webhook": {your webhook url},
	  "metadata": {
      "my-job-id": 1234
      }
   }'
```
* Fill in the file link instead of "https://example.com/path/to/file.mp3"

* Optional : replace `{your webhook url}` with webhook url if needed. If not, remove the line.

Webhook is a method that enables application to transmit data to another application immediately upon the occurrence of an event. Instead of having your application periodically poll for updates, a webhook delivers data to a specified URL as soon as the event accures, facilitating instant communication and minimizing latency. In our case transcription result gets sent to the webhook.  

### Example cURL Get Transcript
```bash
curl https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{my-organization}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/54e84442-3576-45ca-904c-a1d90bc77baf \
   -H "Salad-Api-Key: {your-api-key}"
```

### Step1 | Configure Header
Configure you header to include your unique Salad API URL which can be found above as the variable “API URL”. Also include your unique Salad API key [which can be found here](https://portal.salad.com/api-key) as the variable “Salad-Api-Key”. 

### Step 2 | Set Input Parameters
Update the JSON input parameters to customize your transcription output.

#### "url" 

URL has to be a downloadable link to a file. We recommend using a file service like S3 or Blob that offers secure [presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). It should look like this (https://bucketname.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/filename.mp4?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2). You can't use YouTube links, Google Drive, or other file-sharing services if they do not provide downloadable url's.

Send media in any of these formats.

		*Audio:* AIFF, FLAC, M4A, MP3, WAV
		*Video:* MKV, MOV, WEBM, WMA, MP4 (most codecs), AVI

#### “sentence_level_timestamps”

Sentence level timestamps are returned on default. Set to false if not needed.

#### “word_level_timestamps” 

Set to "true" for word level timestamps. Set to "false” on default.

#### “language_code”

Transcription is available in 97 languages. We automatically identify the source language. “language_code” need to be specified only if diarization is required.

#### “diarization” 

Set to *"true"* for speaker separation and identification. If you don't require it, set it to *"false”*.

Diarization requires the language_code to be defined. By default, it is set to *"en"* (English).
 
You can also diarize in *"fr"* (French), *"de"* (German), *"es"* (Spanish), *"it"* (Italian), *"ja"* (Japanese), *"zh"* (Chinese), *"nl"* (Dutch), *"uk"* (Ukrainian), *"pt"* (Portuguese), *"ar"* (Arabic), *"cs”* (Czech), *"ru"* (Russian), *"pl"* (Polish), *"hu"* (Hungarian), *"fi"* (Finnish), *"fa"* (Persian), *"el"* (Greek), *"tr"* (Turkish), *"da"* (Danish), *"he"* (Hebrew), *"vi"* (Vietnamese), *"ko"* (Korean), *"ur"* (Urdu), *"te"* (Telugu), *"hi"* (Hindi), *"ca"* (Catalan), *"ml"* (Malayalam).


#### “srt” 

Set to *"true"* to generate a .srt output for caption and subtitles. If you don't require it, set it to *"false"*.

### "webhook"

*Optional. Webhook is a method that enables application to transmit data to another application immediately when process is finished. Specify your webhook url to use.

#### "my-job-id"

*Optional. If you need an identifier from your system you can the job id as desired.


### Step 3 | Make Post Request
Make your POST transcript request. If successful, you will recieve a confirmation response that will include the job *"id"* *(ex: 00-681d01e03cec5f7122952100b66f2330-aa5b353301b6bc50-01).

### Step 4 | Make Get Request
Make your GET transcript request. If successful, you will receive a JSON transcript output that will include the inputs you requested.

##### Example Transcript Output

```

**"status"** 

If your transcription request is *“pending”*, it has not yet been picked up for processing. 

*“created”*  the transcription job is now in our queue to be processed. 

*“running”* the transcription is processing. 

*“failed”* the transcript was not created. We will automatically re-try the transcription process until it fails three times. If we are unable to transcribe your media, you will get a 200 error with one of the following messages. Send us a support request at [support@salad.com](https://mailto:support@salad.com/) if this happens.

*"succeeded" the transcript is ready. If we were not able to pull your url, or there was another issue with the audio file you will see an "error" in the response and one of the reasons:

*File size is more than 3GB 
*File can not be downloaded or duration is missing. Please check your file and try again. 
*File duration is more than 2.5 hours

 ## Transcription Automation

Webhooks are already available, and you can check the documentation above (under Example cURL Post Transcript). Using webhooks is a better way to get results as soon as possible. However, if your use case better fits with polling, use the following code. Make sure you update it as needed:
### Pass 1: Submitting Audio Files for Transcription
This part of the script submits audio files for transcription and collects job IDs. The job IDs are used in the second pass to check the status and retrieve the results.

```bash
import requests
import json
# Set the organization name, url, and API key
organization_name = "your_organization_name"
url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
salad_key = "your_salad_key"
language_code = "en"
# Add your audio links here 
list_of_audio_files = [
    "audio_url",
    "audio_url",
    "audio_url",
]
# If you want to pull links from a file, you can use the following code
# with open('audio_links.txt', 'r') as f:
#     list_of_audio_files = f.readlines()
# Placeholder for job_ids
list_of_job_ids = []
headers = {
    "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "accept": "application/json",
}
# Pass 1: Submit audio files for transcription
# Loop through the list of audio files and construct body of each request
for audio_file in list_of_audio_files:
    data = {
        "input": {
            "url": audio_file,
            "language_code": language_code,
            "word_level_timestamps": True,
            "diarization": True,
            "srt": True,
        }
    }
    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    # Pull job id from response. And save it to a list or a file
    job_id = response.json()["id"]
    list_of_job_ids.append(job_id)
    #save job_ids to a file if needed (uncomment the code below)
    # job_id_str = f'"{job_id}",'
    # # Open a file and write the job_id to it
    # with open('queue_test.txt', 'a') as f:
    #     f.write(job_id_str + '\n')

```

### Pass 2: Checking Job Status and Retrieving Results

This part of the script checks the status of each transcription job periodically and retrieves the results once the transcription is completed.

```bash
    # Pass 2. Loop though the job_ids and get the results
    # If you use both passes in the same script, just continue. 
    # If you use scripts separatly you need to set up connection again 
    # and initialize the list of job ids : 
    # Uncomment the code below if you need to 
    # import requests
    # import json
    # Set the organization name, url, and API key
    # organization_name = "your_organization_name"
    # url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs"
    # salad_key = "your_salad_key"
    # language_code = "en"
    # headers = {
    #     "Salad-Api-Key": salad_key,
    #     "Content-Type": "application/json",
    #     "accept": "application/json",
    # }
    # Pull list from a file:
    # with open('queue_test.txt', 'r') as f:
    #     list_of_job_ids = f.readlines()
    # or initialize the list manually
    # list_of_job_ids = ["job_id1", "job_id2", "job_id3", "job_id4"]
import time
# Loop though the job_ids and get the results
while len(list_of_job_ids) > 0:
    for job in list_of_job_ids:
        response_url = f"https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/salad/inference-endpoints/transcribe/jobs/{job}"
        response = requests.get(response_url, headers=headers)
        if response.json()['status'] == 'running' or response.json()['status'] == 'pending':
          print(f"Job {job} is still {response.json()['status']}, waiting for retry...")
          continue
        elif response.json()['status'] == 'succeeded':

            #save the response to a file
            with open(f'result_{job}.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                json.dump(response.json(), f, ensure_ascii=False)  
            #remove the job_id from the list
            list_of_job_ids.remove(job)
        else:
            print(f"Job {job} failed, waiting for retry...")
            # wait for 30 seconds and retry
            time.sleep(30)
            continue

```
