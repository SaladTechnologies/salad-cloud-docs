Although the model was trained on over 97 languages, we highlight those that consistently demonstrate high-quality
results, with a word error rate (WER) of less than 50%, a common benchmark for speech recognition accuracy. For
languages not listed, the model may still generate transcriptions, but the accuracy could fall below acceptable
standards. For the full list of languages supported by Salad Transcription API, please refer to our
[guides page](/guides/transcription/salad-transcription-api/speech-to-text#6-language-code).

## Turnaround Times

The Salad Transcription API operates as a batch, async service, not a real-time service. While most jobs are processed
quickly, turnaround times can vary during peak usage when the queue holds thousands of requests. Our multi-step
processing model runs audio at approximately 5x the standard playback speed, enabling most transcriptions to be
completed faster than the actual audio duration.

We use a **sequential long-form algorithm** for transcription, prioritizing **transcription accuracy** over speed, as
accuracy is our highest priority.

During high-demand periods, there may be increased turnaround times, but our infrastructure is designed to auto-scale as
needed to ensure no job exceeds a processing time of 2 hours.

#### Standard Response Times for a 15-minute (20 MB) Audio Clip:

- ** < 5 minutes**: 95% of jobs
- ** 5-30 minutes**: 3% of jobs
- ** 30-90 minutes**: 2% of jobs
- ** > 90 minutes**: 1% of jobs

_Note_ : These figures are estimates and can vary based on demand.
