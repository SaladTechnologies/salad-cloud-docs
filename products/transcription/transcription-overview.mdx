## Turnaround Times

The Salad Transcription API operates as a batch, async service, not a real-time service. While most jobs are processed
quickly, turnaround times can vary during peak usage when the queue holds thousands of requests.

### Salad Transcription API Processing Speed

Our multi-step processing model runs audio at approximately 5x the standard playback speed, enabling most transcriptions
to be completed faster than the actual audio duration. We use a sequential long-form algorithm for transcription,
prioritizing transcription accuracy over speed.

We use a **sequential long-form algorithm** for transcription, prioritizing **transcription accuracy** over speed, as
accuracy is our highest priority.

During high-demand periods, there may be increased turnaround times, but our infrastructure is designed to auto-scale as
needed to ensure no job exceeds a processing time of 2 hours.

#### Standard Response Times for a 15-minute (20 MB) Audio Clip:

- ** < 5 minutes**: 95% of jobs
- ** 5-30 minutes**: 3% of jobs
- ** 30-90 minutes**: 2% of jobs
- ** > 90 minutes**: 1% of jobs

### Transcription Lite Processing Speed

Transcription Lite is optimized for speed, processing audio at approximately **40x** real-time speed, significantly
reducing turnaround times for transcription-only jobs.

#### Standard Response Times for a 15-minute (20 MB) Audio Clip:

- ** < 30 seconds**: 95% of jobs
- ** 30 seconds - 2 minutes**: 4% of jobs
- ** > 2 minutes**: 1% of jobs

_Note_ : These figures are estimates and can vary based on demand.

## Supported Languages

We offer comprehensive support for a wide range of languages through our API for transcription and translation to
English. These include:

Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish,
Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian,
Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian,
Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil,
Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

Although the model was trained on over 97 languages, we highlight those that consistently demonstrate high-quality
results, with a word error rate (WER) of less than 50%, a common benchmark for speech recognition accuracy. For
languages not listed, the model may still generate transcriptions, but the accuracy could fall below acceptable
standards. For the full list of languages supported by Salad Transcription API, please refer to our
[guides page](/guides/transcription/salad-transcription-api/speech-to-text#6-language-code).

Transcription Lite is optimized for core languages to provide faster processing with lower cost.
