## Turnaround Times

The Salad Transcription API operates as a batch, async service, not a real-time service. While most jobs are processed
quickly, turnaround times can vary during peak usage when the queue holds thousands of requests. Our multi-step
processing model runs audio at approximately 5x the standard playback speed, enabling most transcriptions to be
completed faster than the actual audio duration.

We use a **sequential long-form algorithm** for transcription, prioritizing **transcription accuracy** over speed, as
accuracy is our highest priority.

During high-demand periods, there may be increased turnaround times, but our infrastructure is designed to auto-scale as
needed to ensure no job exceeds a processing time of 2 hours.

#### Standard Response Times for a 15-minute (20 MB) Audio Clip:

- ** < 5 minutes**: 95% of jobs
- ** 5-30 minutes**: 3% of jobs
- ** 30-90 minutes**: 2% of jobs
- ** > 90 minutes**: 1% of jobs

_Note_ : These figures are estimates and can vary based on demand.
