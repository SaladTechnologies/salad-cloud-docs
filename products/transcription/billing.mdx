## How We Calculate the Charge

You are charged based on the duration of your audio file, calculated as a fraction of an hour with two decimal places
for precision. Here’s how it works:

1. **Convert Audio Duration to Hours** Each audio file's length is measured in seconds and divided by 3,600 to calculate
   the duration in hours.

2. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth** The resulting duration is rounded to two decimal places for clarity and precision.

3. **Minimum Billing Unit** The smallest unit we charge for is 0.01 hours, equivalent to 36 seconds of audio. This
   ensures even very short files are fairly billed.

4. **Risk-Free Billing** If a transcription fails for any reason, you will not be charged.

## Examples of Charges

Here are examples to illustrate how charges are calculated based on rate of $0.10 per audio hour. Please
[reach out](mailto:cloud@salad.com) to the team for volume discounts.

- **10 minutes**: `10 minutes = 0.1667 hours → rounded to 0.17 hours` **Cost**: `0.17 hours × $0.10/hour = $0.017`

- **5 minutes**: `5 minutes = 0.0833 hours → rounded to 0.08 hours` **Cost**: `0.08 hours × $0.10/hour = $0.008`

- **2 minutes**: `2 minutes = 0.0333 hours → rounded to 0.03 hours` **Cost**: `0.03 hours × $0.10/hour = $0.003`

- **30 seconds**: `30 seconds = 0.0083 hours → rounded to 0.01 hours` **Cost**: `0.01 hours × $0.10/hour = $0.001`
