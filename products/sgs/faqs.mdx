  <Accordion title="What happens when I first request SGS service in a region?">
    When you first request SGS service, we ask you a few questions. Most important among these are which country you need service in, and how much traffic you anticipate the server will need to handle.
Next, we provision a server in the requested country. If no reliable datacenter infrastructure is available there, a server is provisioned as near as possible to the target country to minimize latency. Each server is dedicated to a single customer's traffic through a single country -- no multi-tenancy. This helps ensure security as well as limit the potential for other customers' traffic to impact yours, and vice versa.

Once the SGS server is configured, we send a signal to SaladCloud Nodes in the target country telling them to connect to
that SGS server. Nodes are selected for eligibility based on a combination of their most recently-tested network speeds
(up/down), ip quality, block rate, and other factors. Nodes are then rank ordered by performance and the best are
selected to connect. The number of nodes allowed to connect is based on the contracted minimum traffic agreed upon, plus
some additional buffer to support overages. If the connection to a node is lost for any reason, it is replaced by a new
node to maintain the required node count.

After internal testing, the SGS is deemed production-ready, and connection details are sent to you. These details will
include the server hostname and port number and the connection password.

    First, test sending a simple curl request through the server with `curl -x 'https://{sessionID}:{password}@{sgsName}:{port}' https://www.ipinfo.io` If that request fails, there could be a network issue or an error on the sgs server side - contact your account manager and we'll take a look. If the request succeeds, ensure that your infrastructure is making requests using the correct protocol. Refer to the connection information sent by your account manager to determine if the SGS server is configured for the `HTTP CONNECT` or the `PROXY v2` protocol. Feel free to reach out to support via Slack and we can help you out.
