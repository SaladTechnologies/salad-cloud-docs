## SGS overview

SGS is a proxy service that routes requests from VPN operators, or other customers who need distributed residential IP
infrastructure, to SaladCloud nodes. SaladCloud Nodes are individually owned and operated desktop PCs whose owners have
explicitly opted in to share their network bandwidth and local compute resources. Node owners, or ‘SaladCloud Chefs’,
are compensated by SaladCloud based on the amount of compute resources or bandwidth they provide to the network.

## How nodes are selected

SGS monitors and orchestrates these nodes while providing sticky session routing and load balancing across them. It
allows parameter-based targeting of nodes by their location and, in certain cases, by the nodes' recently-demonstrated
ability to reach specific streaming services.

Read on to learn how to start sending requests to SGS.
