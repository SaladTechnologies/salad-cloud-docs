# The SGS API

The SGS API enables you to manage streaming capability tags for nodes in your network. By tagging nodes based on their
ability to connect to specific streaming services, you can create optimized routing paths for different workloads. Note
that it is up to you to develop, run, and maintain any such connectivity tests.

> **Important:** The SGS API is currently in limited release and is only available on some SGS servers. Contact your
> account manager to enable this feature.

## How Node Selection Works

When you specify a tag, our system selects nodes in this order:

1. Nodes with your requested tag
2. Nodes with internal tags assigned by Salad's DHC system (if no match is found in step 1)
3. Least-loaded node (if no match is found in steps 1 or 2)

## Usage Examples

### HTTP Headers

Request a node with a specific tag by adding the `X-Sgs-Tag` proxy header to your request:

```
X-Sgs-Tag: {yourTag}
X-Sgs-Capabilities: {yourTag}  (legacy, still supported)
```

### URL Parameters

Alternatively, you can request a node with a specific tag by adding the `&tag=` parameter to the end of your session ID:

```
{sessionId}&tag={yourTag}
{sessionId}&cap={yourTag}  (legacy, still supported)
```

All examples above produce identical routing behavior. Note that the new `X-Sgs-Tag` proxy header replaces the legacy
`X-Sgs-Capabilities` proxy header, while the `&tag=` parameter replaces the legacy `&cap=` parameter. Both headers and
parameters currently function identically, but we recommend using either the `X-Sgs-Tag` proxy header or the `&tag=` URL
parameter for future compatibility.

# Tagging Nodes

## Authentication

All API requests require your Salad-provided JWT token:

```bash
curl https://{sgsName}.salad.com:7443/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SALAD_JWT"
```

Requests without proper authentication will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. JWT tokens were shared with your team
during initial integration; if you need a JWT token, contact your account manager.

## Nodes

### List all nodes

```http
GET /nodes
```

Returns all active, non-quarantined nodes connected to your SGS server.

#### Example response

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "machine_id": "5ebfa363-6e0b-4db1-b9be-70ed4995d0b1",
      "tags": {
        "internal-nflx": 1,
        "internal-dsnp": 1
      },
      "update_time": "2023-05-04T05:41:05Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Retrieve a node

```http
GET /nodes/{machineId}
```

Retrieves information about a specific node.

#### Example response

```json
{
  "machine_id": "5ebfa363-6e0b-4db1-b9be-70ed4995d0b1",
  "tags": {
    "internal-nflx": 1,
    "internal-dsnp": 1
  },
  "update_time": "2023-05-04T05:41:05Z"
}
```

### Retrieve a node's tags

```http
GET /nodes/{machineId}/tags
```

Retrieves only the tags for a specific node.

#### Example response

```json
{
  "internal-nflx": 1,
  "internal-dsnp": 1
}
```

### Update a node

```http
PATCH /nodes/{machineId}/tags
```

Updates capability tags for a specific node.

Tag values must be between 0 and 1, where:

- `0` indicates the node cannot handle the service
- Any value `> 0` and `≤ 1` indicates the node can handle the service
  > **Note:** The rational number tag values (between `0` and `1`) enable future weighted load balancing features.

> **Important:** We recommend using a prefix (like `internal-`) for your tags to avoid conflicts with Salad's existing
> DHC labels.

#### Example request

```json
{
  "internal-nflx": 1,
  "internal-dsnp": 0,
  "internal-itv": 0.8
}
```

### Remove all tags

```http
DELETE /nodes/{machineId}/tags
```

Removes all capability tags from a node. Note that passing a `0` value for a tag is equivalent to removing it.

## Routing behavior

- SGS routes sessions for a service only to nodes with a positive tag value (`> 0`) for that service
- Missing tags are treated as `0` (unroutable)
- If all nodes are unroutable for a requested capability, SGS will "fail open" and distribute traffic across all nodes
- The rational number tag values (between `0` and `1`) enable future weighted load balancing features

## Common workflows

### Qualifying nodes for a new service

1. List all nodes and retrieve their machine IDs:
   ```bash
   curl https://{sgsName}.salad.com:7443/nodes \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SALAD_JWT" | jq '.nodes[] | .machine_id'
   ```
2. For each machine ID, test its connectivity to the target service (e.g., "target-service") by targeting specific
   nodes:
   ```bash
   # Add the X-Sgs-Machine-Id header to test a specific node
   # Do not use &cap= or &tag= in the sessionID during testing
   curl --proxy-header "X-Sgs-Machine-Id: {machineId}" -X https://{sessionID}:{password}@{sgsName}.salad.com:8443 \
     https://target-service.com
   ```
3. Tag nodes which connected successfully (use a unique name for the tag e.g., "internal-target-service"):
   ```bash
   curl PATCH https://{sgsName}.salad.com:7443/nodes/{machineId}/tags \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SALAD_JWT" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"internal-target-service": 1}'
   ```
4. Verify the tags were updated successfully:
   ```bash
   curl https://{sgsName}.salad.com:7443/nodes \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SALAD_JWT"
   ```
5. Adjust your configuration so that any traffic for "target-service" is routed to your tagged nodes by suffixing
   `&tag=internal-target-service` to your session IDs (e.g.,
   "`https://sessionID1234&tag=internal-target-service:{password}@{sgsName}.salad.com`"), or by adding it as a proxy
   header in your request as follows: "`X-Sgs-Tag`:`internal-target-service`".
6. Because nodes occasionally connect and disconnect from SGS, regularly repeat steps 1-3 to ensure your tags are
   up-to-date. The frequency of these checks depends on several factors, but we recommend performing them at least every
   2-3 hours.
