## When to request a node removal

Salad makes a best effort to identify and remove underperforming Salad nodes. However, in the event that a SaladCloud
node becomes blocked by a content provider, or for any other reason fails to meet your requirements, you can request
that it be removed from the list of available IPs and replaced with a fresh node. At the time that the request is
received, the node which is connected to the session ID in the request body will be removed.

If a node becomes unavailable, it will automatically be replaced with a fresh node. For this reason, we recommend that
you submit the node removal request as soon as possible after detecting an underperforming node to avoid inadvertently
removing a fresh node which may have already replaced the underperforming node.

## How to request a node removal

Submit a node removal request by sending a POST request to the following endpoint:
`https://matrix-rest-api.salad.com/api/v2/sgs/$SGSID/removals`

The `SGSID` will be shared with you before the trial period begins.

Set the Authorization header as below: `Authorization: Bearer saladProvidedJwt`

The JWT will be shared with you before the trial period begins.
