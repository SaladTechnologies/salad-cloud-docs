Container Groups are fundamental to the deployment process within the Salad Cloud Environment (SCE). They consist of a
container image, hardware requirements, and a replica count, playing a crucial role in deploying your application on the
Salad network. As the owner of the Container Group, you have the responsibility to manage it, while SCE takes care of
running the group and maintaining the desired replica count.

## Container Group Components

- **[Container Registries](/products/sce/container-registries)**: Specify the container image you want to run in the
  Container Group.
- **Resource Requirements**:
  - [Container Image](/products/sce/container-registries): name(Public or Private).
  - Replica Count: Replicas are the desired number of instances for your container group deployment. We recommend that
    you deploy with 2+ replicas to ensure the uptime of your deployment.
    - For enhanced reliability and smoother operation, we strongly recommend deploying with a minimum of 2 replicas.
      This ensures your applications remain resilient and maintain performance, even if a node becomes temporarily
      unavailable. Scaling beyond a single node not only increases fault tolerance but also optimizes resource
      allocation and load balancing across our distributed cloud infrastructure. Start with 2 or more replicas to unlock
      the full potential of our platform and experience seamless scaling and improved uptime for your containers.
  - Number of vCPUs (1-16): Define the desired number of virtual CPUs for your container.
  - Memory (RAM) (1-30GB): Specify the amount of RAM required for your container.
  - GPUs: Define the number of GPUs needed for your container

- **Additional Parameters**:
  - **[Startup Probe](/products/sce/health-probes/startup-probes)**: Set up a startup probe to check if the container is
    ready to accept traffic.
  - **[Liveness Probe](/products/sce/health-probes/liveness-probes)**: Configure a liveness probe to check if the
    container is healthy.
  - **[Container Gateway](/products/sce/networking)**: Choose between authentication or no authentication for external
    requests and port number for enabling networking inside of container.
  - **[External Logging Service](/products/sce/external-logging)**: Optionally configure an external logging service for
    container logs.
  - **[Environment Variables](/products/sce/environment-variables)**: Define environment variables to customize your
    container's environment.

### Auto-Start Feature

The container configuration page offers an auto-start feature. By default, this feature is enabled, and it automatically
starts the container when the image is pulled. This ensures that your containers are always up to date and readily
available.

Note: For detailed instructions on deploying containers, please refer to our
"[Deploy Container Group](/products/sce/quickstart)" documentation.

## Container Group Actions

Container Group actions allow you to create, manage, and modify your container deployments effectively. To access the
container group actions you first need to deploy a container.

- **Create** : Create a new Container Group. When created, it is not yet running on nodes.
- **Start** : Initiate a deployment of the Container Group on the Salad network.
- **Stop**: Stop the current deployment, pausing all active Container Instances. Stopped Container Groups can be started
  again.
- **Refresh**: Refresh allows you to update the status and information of a Container Group without making significant
  changes to the group itself. The details automatically refresh every few seconds, so there should not be many
  situations where the refresh option is needed.
- **Duplicate**: Create a copy of an existing Container Group, allowing for easy replication of settings and
  configurations.
- **Edit**: Update the display name, replica count, image source, resource requirements, and other configuration
  settings of a Container Group once it has been created.
- **Delete**: Delete a Container Group and all associated information. This action is irreversible.
