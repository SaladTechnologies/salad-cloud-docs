## SaladCloud Infrastructure

SaladCloud is a distributed network with nodes located worldwide, ranging from esports arenas to personal computers.
This global network allows us to offer computing resources at exceptionally low prices and gives us the ability to grow
the network by hundreds of nodes a day when needed.

It is important to understand that as a result, the nodes powering our network can disconnect at any time, stopping
container instances running on the node. When this happens we automatically reallocate these instances to a new node as
quickly as possible.

Although some nodes may remain connected for days at a time, maintaining constant uptime requires multiple replicas for
redundancy.

## Priority Levels

Priority levels let you balance interruptions and cost savings according to your needs. Container Groups run at one of
four priority levels on our network: High, Medium, Low, or Batch. Lower priority levels have reduced costs. Higher
priority container groups can preempt lower priority ones if a higher-paying job becomes available. If you find that
instances at a lower priority level are reallocating too frequently for your needs, you can edit the container group to
select a higher priority level.

After adding a GPU to your container group, you can choose between priority levels. At the highest priority level, your
container group instances will not be interrupted _by other workloads_. However, high priority instances **will** still
be reallocated if your container exits, you request a reallocation, or the node powering the instance disconnects.
Container groups without a GPU always run at the Batch priority level, and can be interrupted by any container group
requesting a GPU.
