To enable external logging service via HTTP on SaladCloud , you need to configure your Container Group Deployment with
the appropriate HTTP endpoint details. SaladCloud External Logging supports HTTP endpoints for receiving logs. This
example will guide you through the setup using an HTTP service.

## Prerequisite

Before configuring the HTTP external logging service, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. HTTP Endpoint: Have an HTTP endpoint (URL) ready to receive logs. This endpoint should be publicly reachable.
2. Port Availability: Choose a port number between 1 to 65535 for the HTTP service. Ensure that the selected port is
   available and not blocked by firewalls.
3. Authentication and Headers(Optional): If your HTTP service requires authentication or specific headers, gather the
   necessary information such as username, password, and custom headers.

## Step 1: Have a Publicly Accessible HTTP Endpoint

Ensure that you have an HTTP endpoint that is publicly accessible. This endpoint should be ready to receive logs.

## Step 2: Provide Information to SCE

while container group creation or configuration process at SaladCloud portal, locate the "External Logging Services"
section in Optional Settings.

1. Locate the "External Logging Services" section in the Optional Settings.
2. Click on ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù for External Logging Services.
3. In the provided form, fill in the following details:
   1. Host: Enter the IP address or hostname of the machine where your HTTP service is running.
   2. Port: Choose a port number between 1 and 65535. Ensure it matches the port on your publicly accessible HTTP
      endpoint.
   3. Path (Optional): Specify a valid path if required by your HTTP endpoint.
   4. User (Optional): If your HTTP service requires authentication, provide the username.
   5. Password (Optional): If your HTTP service requires authentication, provide the password.
   6. Headers (Optional): If your HTTP service requires custom headers, provide the name and value pairs.
   7. Click ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù to save the provided information.

Once you've provided the necessary information, deploy the Container Group by clicking on the ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù and "Start"
buttons.

## Step 4: Verify Logs in HTTP Service

After the container is running, logs from your containers should be streaming to the specified HTTP endpoint. Verify
that your HTTP service is receiving the logs.
