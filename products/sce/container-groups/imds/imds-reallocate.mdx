title: 'Using IMDS to reallocate a replica'
---

_Last Updated: June 3, 2025_

Using the IMDS, you can reallocate a replica from within the running container. This is often done in combination with
[performance monitoring](/tutorials/performance-monitoring) to allow applications to self-monitor and reject
under-performing nodes. You can find code samples and the full API reference in the
[IMDS API documentation](/reference/imds/reallocate). This endpoint requires you to provide a reason for reallocation,
which we use to continuously improve our service.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://169.254.169.254/v1/reallocate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Metadata: true' \
  --data '{
  "reason": "Insufficient Upload Bandwidth"
}'
```
