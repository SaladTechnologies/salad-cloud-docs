title: 'Using IMDS to reallocate a replica'
---

_Last Updated: April 10, 2025_

Using the IMDS, you can reallocate a replica from within the running container. This is often done in combination with
[performance monitoring](/tutorials/performance-monitoring) to allow applications to self-monitor and reject
under-performing nodes. You can find code samples and the full API reference in the
[IMDS API documentation](/reference/imds/reallocate-container). This endpoint requires you to provide a reason for
reallocation, which we use to continuously improve our service.
