# How do I use SSH with Salad?

Since SCE is a managed container service running on spot instance like infrastructure SSH is not recommended since the
session or changes you make could disappear without warning. By putting bundling your application in a container, you
will be sure that each replica running on SaladCloud is running in a consistent and reproducible way.

# I need a unique URL for each node. How do I do that?

The best way to accomplish this is to create container groups with the Container Gateway enabled and with 1 replica
each, because each container group with the Container Gateway enabled receives a static, unique URL. For large numbers
of container groups, we recommend managing these container groups programmatically through the API.
