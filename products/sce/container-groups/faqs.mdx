# How do I use SSH with Salad?

Salad does not support SSH access to containers. If you need to access a running container, you can use the

each, because each container group with the Container Gateway enabled receives a static, unique URL. For large numbers
of container groups, we recommend managing these container groups programmatically through the API.
