# How Disk Space is Calculated

When you deploy a workload to the SaladCloud Network, nodes are filtered on the criteria that you specify. If you do not
specify disk space requirements, nodes are provided which meet a minimum free space allotment. This is calculated based
on the size of the downloaded container, plus some extra buffer to account for operations like extracting the container,
installing dependencies, and caching results.

# Requesting additional Disk Space on nodes

If you expect to need significantly more free space on your nodes than your container itself requires, configure it by
selecting a Disk Space option when configuring your container group in the Portal or in the API by passing
a`"storage_amount": x` in megabytes on the resources object.
