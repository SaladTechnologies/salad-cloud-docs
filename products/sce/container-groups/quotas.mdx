title: 'Quotas'

_Last Updated: May 12, 2025_

Each organization has a quota for the total number of replicas used across container groups. This includes replicas from
all created container groups, whether running or not. If autoscaling is enabled, the “Maximum Replicas” value is counted
toward your quota. You can distribute these replicas among container groups as needed, but each container group is
limited to a maximum of 500 replicas.

If you are running low on quota, you can request an increase via the Portal quotas page, or by contacting our
[support team](mailto:cloud@salad.com). Alternatively, you can delete unused container groups or reduce their replica
count.
