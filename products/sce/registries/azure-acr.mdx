1. Obtain your Azure service account key

NOTE: In Salad Portal, we are only going to get and make use of **Username** and **Password** from any of the listed
three authentication method from Azure and here are the links their official documentation for each of the
authentication methods blow including their pros and cons.

### Azure AD Service Principal

[Link to guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)

**Pros:**

1. Better security: Service principal allows for more secure authentication than using a shared user account.
2. Granular Access Control: You can assign specific permissions to the service principal, ensuring it has only the
   access it needs and nothing more.
3. Automating access management: Service principal is a great way to automate authentication and authorization to access
   Azure resources using code or scripts.

**Cons:**

1. Complexity: The service principal requires additional configuration steps, which can be challenging for inexperienced
   users.
2. Lack of visibility: Unlike a user account, it can be more difficult to track which service principal is accessing
   which resources.
3. Additional maintenance: Managing the lifecycle of a service principal can add to the overall management burden of the
   application.

### Admin User

This authentication method refers to a user account that has been granted administrative privileges in an Azure
subscription or resource group. Admin Users are able to perform administrative tasks such as creating and managing
resources, setting permissions and access policies, and configuring settings that affect the entire subscription or
resource group.

**Pros:**

1. Easy to generate: Admin users can be created and granted access quickly and easily.
2. Broad Access: Admin users have access to all resources within an account, which can be useful for managing multiple
   resources.
3. Flexible: Admin users can be granted temporary access as needed and then removed when no longer required.

**Cons:**

1. Security Risks: Admin users pose a greater security risk as they have unrestricted access to all resources within an
   account.
2. Lack of Granular Control: Admin users canâ€™t be assigned granular permissions, which can lead to overprivileged
   access( i.e Admins may have too much access because they can't be given specific permissions leading to security
   risks)
3. Difficult to Audit: Because admin users have access to all resources, it can be challenging to track their activity
   and audit their actions.

### Repository-Scoped Access Token

To create a repository-scoped access token in Azure, you'll need to follow the steps outlined in the guide you linked
to, which involves creating a personal access token in GitHub, then using that token to authenticate with Azure.

**Pros:**

1. Specific Access: Repository-scoped access tokens can be scoped to specific repositories, ensuring that only the
   necessary resources are accessed.
2. Enhance Security: Tokens can be revoked at any time, providing an additional layer of security in case of a breach or
   unauthorized access.
3. No impact on users: Repository-scoped access tokens can be used to provide access without the need for user accounts.

**Cons:**

1. Requires Enterprise Plan: This method requires an enterprise plan, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations
   or individuals.
2. Limited scope: Repository-scoped access tokens are limited to the resources they are scoped to and canâ€™t be used to
   access other resources.
3. Complexity: Managing access tokens can be complex and require additional configuration and management steps.

Note: The Azure AD Service Principal documentation is for Azure AD, but the same concept applies to other Azure services
such as Azure Container Registry.

2. Access the Salad portal, Set up your SCE by selecting the private registry tab when setting the image source. In the
   service dropdown option, choose "Azure Container Registry" and provide the following information:
   - Image name (example: `https://myregistry.azurecr.io/my-repository/my-image:v1.0`)
   - Username and Password

3. Continue to configure and deploy your container group
