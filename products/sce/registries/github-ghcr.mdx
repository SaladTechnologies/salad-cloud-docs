[GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io) (GHCR) is a powerful platform for hosting and managing container images.
You can store and manage Docker in the Container registry.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account
- A Docker image that you want to publish to GHCR
- Docker installed on your local machine

To deploy image from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to Salad Portal, follow these steps:

### Step 1 : Create a [Personal Access Token ](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)(PAT)

1. Go to your GitHub Settings page.
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Security & admin."
3. Under "Personal access tokens," click "Generate new token."
4. Provide a descriptive name for your token and select the packages:write permission.
5. Click "Generate token" and make sure to copy the generated PAT to a safe place. You won't be able to see it again.

### Step 2 : Authenticate to the Registry

You can authenticate to GHCR using either the Docker CLI or the GitHub CLI.

1. Authenticate using the Docker CLI: Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing your_username and
   your_PAT with your GitHub username and the PAT you generated: `docker login ghcr.io -u your_username -p your_PAT`
2. Authenticate using the GitHub CLI : If you prefer using the GitHub CLI, run this command and replace your_PAT with
   your PAT: `gh auth login --with-token your_PAT`

### Step 3: Tag Your Docker Image

To prepare your Docker image for GHCR, you need to tag it with the appropriate name. Replace your_image, your_username,
your_repo, and tag_name with your image's name and your GitHub information:

`docker tag your_image ghcr.io/your_username/your_repo:tag_name`

### Step 4 : Push Your Image to the Registry

Now that your image is tagged correctly, you can push it to GHCR:

`docker push ghcr.io/your_username/your_repo:tag_name`

### Step 5: Configure Salad Container Environment (SCE)

Access the Salad portal and configure your SCE with the following information:

1. Username and Personal Access Token that we generated in the beginning.
2. Image name from your private registry.

### Step 6 : Start the Container

With all configurations in place, click the "Start" button in the Salad portal to launch your container using the
private Github registry image.
