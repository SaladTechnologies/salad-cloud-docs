title: 'Container Registries'
---

A container registry is a collection of repositories designed to efficiently store and distribute container images. SCE
integrates with the most popular container registries, allowing you to use your existing build pipelines to create and
manage your container images.

When a Container Group is created, Salad will automatically pull the image from your registry into a private container
registry that is managed by Salad, allowing us to generate 1-time access tokens that are only distributed to specific
machines that are designated to run your application.

Salad supports both Public and Private Registries, many providers offer both options depending on your specific
requirements. A private registry allows users to store and distribute container images without making them publicly
accessible. This allows for better control over the distribution of images, as well as the ability to keep proprietary
or sensitive information secure.

# Specifying the Container Image Source

When configuring a Container Group for deployment, you'll need to specify the source of the container image. If your
image is hosted on the Docker Hub Registry, you don't need to include the registry name. If your image is hosted on
another registry, such as GitHub Container Registry, you'll need to include the registry path. This path is similar to a
URL, but doesn't contain a protocol specifier (e.g. `https://`). You may optionally append a tag, as well. Note that if
no tag is supplied, the `:latest` tag will be used by default.

> ```Text shell
> docker manifest inspect $REMOTEIMAGESOURCE
> ```
>
> If you're building using Docker, you can specify the output manifest spec using `buildx`:
>
> ```Text shell
> docker buildx build \
> -t $LOCALIMAGESOURCE \
> --provenance=false \
> --output type=docker \
> .
> ```

### Examples

- Image hosted on Docker Hub, with the tag `v1` -
  - Full URL: `docker.io/myname/imagename:v1`
  - Shortened URL: `myname/myimagename:v1`
- Image hosted on GHCR, latest version - `ghcr.io/myorg/imagename`

# Supported Registries

Details of using a Private Container Registry with SaladCloud will vary depending on the private registry used. Guides

# Requirements

To use a registry, an image must first be pushed to the registry. This can be done using the docker push command,
specifying the registry URL and the image name. Once the image is in the registry, it can be pulled and used to create a
new Container Group through the Portal or the Public API.

- Salad requires authentication details to pull images, but authentication details are only stored long enough to pull
  the image and place it into encrypted storage for distribution to the Salad Network.
- When we distribute a workload to a node, we generate a 1 time access token, allowing only specific node(s) to download
  and run the container image
- There currently a max **image size of 20 GB (note: subject to change)**
- We pull and store images at moment of container group creation, so if the image is modified you will have to create a
  new container group

### View Status When Creating a Container Group

- While the image is being pulled and stored, the container group status will be "pending"
- Once the image is ready, the container group status will change to stopped, and the container group can be started.

### Failures

A few unique failures can occur when pulling an image from a registry

- **Failure to authenticate**: This will occur if we are unable to authenticate to the private registry with the
  credentials provided. Double check the credentials are correct and try again.
- **Failure to store**: This will occur if we are unable to store the container image. This should be a temporary
  condition so try again.
- **Image too large**: This will occur if the container image is too large. You will need to use a smaller container
  image.
