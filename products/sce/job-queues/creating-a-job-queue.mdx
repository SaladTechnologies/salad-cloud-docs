# Using the Portal

Create a Job Queue in the Portal by clicking the Job Queues link in the left sidebar, then selecting 'Create New Job
Queue'. Enter a name for your job queue and press 'Create'.

> A Job Queue can be connected to multiple container groups at once. but a container group can only be connected to at
> most a single Job Queue.

When configuring a new container group, click the 'Edit' link next to the Job Queues card:

Select your previously-created Job Queue from the 'Select a Job Queue' dropdown. (If you haven't yet created a Job
Queue, press the 'Create New Job Queue' button and do so before returning to this page).

Enter the Port and Path of your application that you identified during the
[Configuring the Job Queue Worker](/products/sce/job-queues/job-queues/queue-worker) step. This information will be attached to
jobs sent to the Queue Worker so that it knows where to post them to the application running inside the deployed
container.

**We also recommend adding a [readiness probe](/products/sce/container-groups/health-probes/readiness-probes) to your
container deployment**. This probe will allow your replica to announce to the Job Queue Service when it's ready to
receive and process jobs. We recommend using it in conjunction with a startup probe. Readiness probes will start to run
after a startup probe succeeds. Without a startup or readiness probe, the Job Queue Worker will immediately start to
look for jobs, even if your application inside is not yet ready to receive jobs. If this happens, the job will fail and
youâ€™ll need to submit it again.

How the readiness probe is configured will depend on your container image, and how itâ€™s configured inside. Many prebuilt
containers or http-apps found in open-source libraries will have a liveness API URL you can check, that will respond
with a 200 code when itâ€™s ready to receive work. Other times, any pre-requisite work may be done before the server
starts, and the server starts up as the last step, so any health-check endpoint would work. In a Whisper Large v3
example below, this is what we have. If your container does not contain a way to check health statuses, you may need to
add one of your own. You can usually find any references to this in the readme or documentation for the container image
you are using. Readiness probes can flip between passing and failing, and will continue to check until itâ€™s ready to go.

Finally, finish configuring your container group before deploying it. When selecting your image source, ensure you
select the container image you configured in the previous step.
