title: 'SaladCloud Secure'
---

**SaladCloud Secure** is our high-trust infrastructure tier designed for enterprise customers with elevated compliance,
reliability, and security requirements. Unlike SaladCloud Community, which offers cost-effective compute from idle GPUs
in residential environments, SaladCloud Secure provides access to powerful GPUs hosted in professionally managed and
physically secured datacenters — with the same cost-saving model under the hood.

## What Does Security Look Like on SaladCloud Secure?

SaladCloud Secure nodes are hosted in professionally managed datacenters operated by partners with strong security
postures and third-party compliance audits. These facilities are designed for high-trust workloads and meet the
expectations of enterprise AI teams.

Key security attributes:

- **SOC 2 Type 2 attested** datacenter partners
- **Restricted physical access**, including 24/7 surveillance and badge-based entry controls
- **Hardware-level isolation** — no shared cores or memory across tenants
- **Local storage is isolated per job and wiped after use**
- **All data in transit is encrypted**
- Salad workloads run in isolated, containerized environments with **no cross-job memory access**

While the underlying compute resources are dynamically scheduled based on availability, the infrastructure itself meets
high standards for privacy, data handling, and operational security.

## Datacenter-Grade Infrastructure

SaladCloud Secure deployments are built on modern infrastructure that matches best practices from leading enterprise GPU
clouds.

### Network & Performance

SaladCloud Secure nodes are provisioned with **a minimum of 1 Gbps bandwidth per server**, ensuring fast data transfers
and low-latency performance for AI/ML workloads.

- **External bandwidth**: ≥ 1 Gbps per node (up/down)
- **Redundant internet uplinks** for automatic failover
- **DDoS mitigation systems** in place
- Internal switching designed for **multi-100 Gbps aggregate throughput**
- Datacenter targets:
  - Packet loss < 0.1%
  - P95 RTT < 4ms
  - P95 jitter < 3ms

### Storage Expectations

SaladCloud Secure servers are equipped with **high-speed NVMe local storage** designed for performance during active
compute jobs.

- Each node provides **fast, isolated local storage** for use during job execution — ideal for temporary datasets, model
  layers, and intermediate outputs
- **Local storage is not persistent across interruptions**; data is **cleared** if a node is reclaimed or rebooted
- For workloads requiring persistence, you can optionally **integrate external object storage (e.g., S3-compatible)** or
  configure periodic syncing from your container

> **Note**: SaladCloud Secure does not currently provide persistent volumes across job interruptions. If your workload
> requires long-term data retention, we recommend syncing with remote storage or using checkpointing.

## Performance, Uptime & Cost

- **GPU Types Available**:
  - 8x **NVIDIA A100 (80 GB)** Perfect for large-scale training and production inference
  - 8x **NVIDIA A100 (40 GB)** Great for models fine-tuning, and production inference workloads
  - 8x **NVIDIA L40S (48 GB)** Ready for generative AI, rendering, and production inference
- **Provisioned in full 8-GPU sets** for maximum performance and bandwidth across multi-GPU jobs
- **Uptime**: Machines remain interruptible but are hosted in stable datacenters with redundant power and secured
  environments — ensuring significantly higher uptime than residential nodes.
- **Cost**: Despite datacenter-grade hardware and security, **SaladCloud Secure is priced significantly lower than other
  enterprise GPU offerings.** Datacenters often have idle capacity between large reservations — SaladCloud takes
  advantage of these gaps to access premium GPUs at the lowest possible cost and pass those savings directly to our
  customers.

## How Do I Access or Monitor GPU Availability?

You’ll soon be able to check and reserve SaladCloud Secure inventory directly from the Salad Portal or via API. For

## SaladCloud Community vs. Secure

| Feature           | **SaladCloud Community**      | **SaladCloud Secure**                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Environment**   | Idle gaming PCs (residential) | Idle GPUs in secure datacenters        |
| **Security**      | SOC 2                         | SOC 2 Type 2, 24/7 datacenter security |
| **GPU Types**     | Consumer-grade                | A100 (80GB), A100 (40GB), L40S (48GB)  |
| **Resource Unit** | Single GPU                    | Full sets of 8 GPUs per Instance       |
| **Uptime**        | Best-effort                   | Higher stability, still interruptible  |
| **Pricing**       | Lowest on the market          | Still lowest on the market             |
