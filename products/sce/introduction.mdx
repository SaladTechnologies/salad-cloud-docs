Containers provide a portable and immutable format for packaging, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications at
scale. **Salad Container Engine (SCE)** offers fully managed container orchestration, dynamically distributes workloads
to optimal hardware cohorts according to your technical requirements, and features GPU-accelerated compute on every
available node instance.

It's the fastest, simplest, and most affordable way to run containerized HPC workloadsâ€”without managing virtual machines
or underlying compute infrastructure.

We highly recommend checking out the [FAQs](/products/sce/faqs) for more information on how SCE works.

# Supported Workflows

SaladCloud offers two methods for creating and managing your deployments:

### Portal

The **Portal** is a browser-based UI at [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com) that provides full control
over your deployments, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. The Portal also offers access to
organization management, billing, and support.

### SaladCloud API

For deeper integration, the **SaladCloud API** also offers full control over your deployments. Occasionally, new
features are available via the API before being surfaced in the Portal. You can access our API documentation
[here](/reference/saladcloud-api).

# Defining Workloads

In Salad Container Engine terminology, container deployments are called **Container Groups**. Each Container Group
represents a set of "identical" **Container Instances** that each run on dedicated hardware.

### Container Groups

A Container Group is defined by a container image, the required hardware resources, and a predetermined number of
**replicas** to be maintained at all times. Once a Container Group has been defined, SCE automatically creates or
removes Container Instances as needed to reach the desired replica count.

For enhanced reliability and smoother operation, we strongly recommend deploying with a minimum of 2 replicas. This
ensures your applications remain resilient and maintain performance, even if a node becomes temporarily unavailable.
Scaling beyond a single node not only increases fault tolerance but also optimizes resource allocation and load
balancing across our distributed cloud infrastructure. Start with 2 or more replicas to unlock the full potential of our
platform, enabling seamless scaling and improved uptime for your containers.

Container Groups can be created, started, stopped, or scaled via the SaladCloud API and UI, giving you direct control
over your workloads before and after deployment.

### Container Instances

A Container Instance is a single instantiation of a container on a dedicated host connected to the Salad network. Each
time a container is deployed to a SaladCloud machine node, a new Container Instance is created with a unique ID and
discrete logs.

# Compute Environment

SaladCloud uses hardware-native virtualization and industry-standard container runtimes to standardize the compute
environment across a distributed network of diverse hardware.

Once a container image has been deployed, SCE instantiates replicas on a predetermined number of available physical
devices, running them as stateless processes within virtual Linux subsystems.

### Host Environment

All SCE container instances deploy to consumer-owned hardware running modern Windows NT operating systems (Windows 10 or
later). This allows the SaladCloud desktop client to leverage Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization features, manage and
monitor workloads, and boot genuine Linux kernels using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

> ðŸ“˜ Supported Containers
>
> Currently, SCE supports Linux containers on AMD64 (also known as x86-64). Container image manifests must be Docker
> compliant (e.g., Docker image manifest v1 or v2) or OCI compliant. ARM architecture is not supported at this time.
> Windows containers are not supported at this time.

### Stateless Execution

Active SCE container instances are treated as stateless workloads. Whenever the virtual execution context closes (due to
down-scaling, batch job termination, or failure), the container image is removed from the host machine's local memory.
While running, the SaladCloud container orchestrator uses heartbeat monitoring to assess potential interruptions or
failures, and determines when and how best to dynamically fail over to another dedicated node for maximum availability.

### Open-source Dependencies

SaladCloud incorporates trusted, well-established tooling for reliable performance and replicable results. The
SaladCloud API adheres to **[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)** specifications and generates templates in various
programming languages to facilitate testing and development. When deployed from the SaladCloud API or UI, SCE container
instances run on the latest stable version of the open-source **[containerd](https://containerd.io/)** runtime.

# Use Cases

SaladCloud's affordable infrastructure is as versatile as your imagination. Here are just a few examples of what you can
build with SCE:

- Use AI models to perform image generation, text-to-audio, image captioning, and related tasks.
- Proxy video-streaming requests for virtual private networks.
- Run long-duration data processing queues.
- Execute massively parallel workloads.
- Distribute 3D rendering or VFX queues.
- Conduct procedurally-generated mapping simulations.

# Additional Considerations

Developers interested in using SCE should note the following:

### AMD64 Architecture

SaladCloud currently **supports only AMD64 architecture** for container instances. ARM architecture **is not supported**
at this time. If you are developing on a Mac or other ARM-based system, you may need to cross-compile your application
for AMD64. Docker supports [multi-architecture builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/), so you
can build your application for both ARM and AMD64 at the same time using the `--platform` flag:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```

### Cold-start Overhead

Cold-start times on SaladCloud can be longer than on traditional clouds. This is primarily due to the time it takes to
download container images to the host machine. Since host machines are consumer-owned, they often have slower internet
connections than datacenters.

### Data-sensitivity Compliance

Customers in regulated industries may be legally required to protect sensitive data, such as medical records or private
financial information. While SaladCloud takes precautions to secure every workload on our network, we cannot guarantee
that our solutions are compliant with requirements of certain regulatory bodies or legislative authorities (including,
but not limited to, HIPAA and the Financial Modernization Act of 1999).

### Scaling Container Groups

Although SCE maintains a stable replica count within each Container Group, SCE deployments do not currently auto-scale
Container Groups based on performance. You must scale Container Groups up or down on demand through the Portal or via
the SaladCloud API.

### Persistent Storage

SaladCloud does not currently support persistent storage for container instances. All data written to the container
instance's filesystem is ephemeral and will be lost when the container instance is terminated. If you need persistent
storage, use an external storage service such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. We recommend a
vendor that does not charge egress fees, as SaladCloud nodes are globally distributed and egress fees can add up
quickly.

### WSL2

SaladCloud uses Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) to run Linux containers on Windows machines. Customers may notice
that less than 100% of VRAM is available to the containerâ€”WSL2 reserves a small portion of VRAM for the Windows host.

### Performance Variability

Because SaladCloud nodes are individual residential gaming PCs, some performance variability should be expected. Your
container group may request 3 nodes with 2 vCPU, 12GB RAM, and an RTX 4090, but within those criteria, there can still
be significant differences in network, compute, and storage performance. It is important to monitor your application's
performance over time and reallocate underperforming nodes as needed.
