title: 'Quotas'
---

Each Organization has a Quota which defines the maximum number of container groups and replicas that can be deployed on
SaladCloud. You can request an increase to your Quota via the portal, or by reaching out to our support team
[here](mailto:cloud@salad.com).

## There are four quota types on Salad Cloud:

- **Container Group Deployments:** The maximum number of container groups you can have deployed at any one time. Note
  that stopped container group deployments count against your quota.
- **Container Group Replicas:** The maximum number of individual replicas (instances of your container image) that you
  can have in a container group.
