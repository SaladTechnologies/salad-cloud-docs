## Deploying Your First Application on SaladCloud

Welcome to Salad Container Engine (SCE), a fully managed container service for deploying AI and simulation workloads to
our global network of idle GPUs. Unlike traditional cloud providers, SaladCloud operates a decentralized marketplace
where individuals can sell idle compute time on their PCs, and businesses can run workloads at industry-low costs.

This guide walks you through deploying a simple FastAPI application on SCE. Before continuing, make sure you have:

- A [SaladCloud account](https://portal.salad.com)
- An organization created in the portal
- At least a few dollars in credits added to your account

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Application

We'll deploy a simple FastAPI server with a `GET /hello` endpoint and basic probe endpoints (`/started`, `/live`,
`/ready`). The `/hello` route returns a greeting and the machine ID via environment variable injection at runtime. While
the probe routes aren't meaningful in this demo, SCE can use them to manage container lifecycle events.

```python app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import os

salad_machine_id = os.getenv("SALAD_MACHINE_ID", "localhost")

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/hello")
async def hello_world():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!", "salad_machine_id": salad_machine_id}


@app.get("/started")
async def startup_probe():
    return {"message": "Started!"}


@app.get("/ready")
async def readiness_probe():
    return {"message": "Ready!"}


@app.get("/live")
async def liveness_probe():
    return {"message": "Live!"}
```

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile uses the Python 3.13 base image, installs dependencies, and runs the server with `uvicorn`. Ensure your
server listens on both IPv4 and IPv6 by using `--host *`, as SaladCloud requires IPv6 compatibility.

```dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

# It is important to use `--host *` to allow access on ipv6
# networks, such as SaladCloud.
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "*", "--port", "8000"]
```

---

## Step 2: Push Your Container Image

Build and push your container image to a registry. In this example, we use
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/saladtechnologies/misc/hello-world/images/sha256-37cd1bf360e4858a1820b0432f278d83a2eb8e8a75f700df79e481686226b8b4):

```shell
docker build -t saladtechnologies/misc:hello-world .
docker push saladtechnologies/misc:hello-world
```

Images up to 35 GB (compressed) are supported.

---

## Step 3: Create a Container Group

In the [SaladCloud Portal](https://portal.salad.com):

1. Navigate to your organization and project (e.g., ‚Äúsalad-benchmarking / Default‚Äù).
2. Click **Create Container Group**.
3. Choose **Custom** (instead of a preconfigured Recipe).
4. Set the name to `hello-world`.
5. Under **Image Source**, enter `saladtechnologies/misc:hello-world`.
6. Set **Replicas** to 3 for high availability across potentially unreliable nodes.
7. Skip env vars and command overrides for this example (optional: use `sleep infinity` for debugging).
8. Configure **Hardware**:

   - CPU: 1 vCPU
   - RAM: 1 GB
   - GPU: None (select one or more if needed; Salad matches your workload to one).

9. Skip **Storage** for this example (note: storage is ephemeral).

---

## Step 4: Configure Network Access

- Enable **Container Gateway** to expose your app via a load balancer.
- Set **Port** to `8000`.
- Choose **Round Robin** load balancing for this demo (Least Connections is preferred for AI workloads).
- Authentication is optional‚Äîif enabled, include your Salad API key in the `Salad-Api-Key` header.
- Optionally restrict concurrency to 1 request per instance. Not relevant for this demo, but useful for workloads with
  high vram usage.

---

## Step 5: Set Health Probes

Configure HTTP probes to manage instance lifecycle:

### Startup Probe (`/started`)

- Initial Delay: `0`
- Period: `1s`
- Timeout: `1s`
- Success Threshold: `1`
- Failure Threshold: `5`

### Liveness Probe (`/live`)

- Starts after startup probe succeeds
- Detects deadlocks or unresponsive processes
- Failure Threshold: `3`

### Readiness Probe (`/ready`)

- Controls load balancer routing
- Can be used to reject new traffic during internal queue saturation

Refer to the [probe documentation](https://docs.salad.com/docs/container-engine/probes) for full details.

---

## Step 6: Deploy

- Enable **Auto Start**.
- Click **Deploy**.
- Watch your instances move through ‚ÄúAllocating‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúStarting‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúReady‚Äù.
- Each replica is assigned to its own machine.
- You will not be billed while instances are down or being reallocated.

---

## Step 7: Test Your Deployment

- Access the app via the container gateway URL (e.g., `https://abc123.saladcloud.io/hello`).
- The response should include the text `Hello, World!` and a machine ID.
- Refreshing may show different machine IDs as traffic is distributed.

---

## Step 8: Monitor and Debug

- **Instance Details**: Run shell commands or inspect logs.
- **System Events**: View instance reallocations, exit codes, and lifecycle events.
- **Container Logs**: View logs across all instances (use an external provider like [Axiom](https://axiom.co) for
  production).

---

## Clean Up

- Click **Stop** to terminate the container group and stop billing.
