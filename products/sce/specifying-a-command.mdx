title: 'Specifying a command'
---

Providing “command” overrides the ENTRYPOINT and CMD of a container image, similar to the CLI `docker run --entrypoint`
flag.

The first item in command is executed as the entrypoint, and subsequent items are provided as arguments.

Note that if a command is specified, any ENTRYPOINT and CMD set in the dockerfile are overridden. If needed, `command`
can be used to add additional arguments to a container, by including the existing CMD or ENTRYPOINT of the image.

As an example, running `docker run --entrypoint /bin/test my-container:latest arg1 arg2 arg3` would correspond to the
SaladCloud command of

```json
["/bin/test", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
```

**Note:** in the portal, you should not include include quotes around arguments. To reproduce the docker command line
`docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash my-docker/my-container:latest -c "python server.py"`, you would enter `/bin/bash` as
the command, `-c` as a first argument, and `python server.py` as a second argument, without quotes.

> 🚧 Caution
>
> Specifying a command overrides the CMD and ENTRYPOINT from your dockerfile. This should only be used if you want to
> override what is already in your dockerfile.
>
> This is not synonymous with `docker run`.
