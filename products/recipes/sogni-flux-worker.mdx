## Overview

This recipe streamlines the process of deploying the Sogni Fast Worker for Flux. You will need a Sogni API Key, and NFT
Token ID to use this recipe.
[Read the Sogni Docs For More Info.](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/running-sogni-fast-worker-remotely)

### Replica Count

The recipe must use only one replica.

### Deploy It And Wait

When you deploy the recipe, SaladCloud will find a qualified node, and begin the process of downloading the container
image to the host machine. It may take up to tens of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network
conditions of that particular node. Remember, these are privately owned pcs with gaming gpus in a variety of networking
conditions, and performance will vary across different nodes.

Eventually, you will see your instance enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the “Ready” column. At
this time the container group will be considered running.
