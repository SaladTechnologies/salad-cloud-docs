## Overview

This recipe deploys the [Qwen2.5 VL 3B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) model by Qwen, a
powerful vision-language model from Alibaba. It uses
[Huggingface Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) as an
inference server. The model is capable of generating text from images, and can be used for a variety of tasks such as
image captioning, document question answering, and more.

## Example Output

**Image**

**Prompt**

What is in this image? Include details.

**Output**

The image depicts a street scene in a town with signs for a hotel, shops, and possibly a restaurant. Notable objects in
the image include:

- A “Peace Way Hotel” sign prominently displayed on the left side of the street. This sign is likely nearby the hotel.
- Multiple closed storefronts indicating a quiet day and/or area where businesses are closed.
- A clear road with cars, potentially indicating moderate traffic volume.
- Buildings with various signs and storefronts, suggesting a commercial area.
- Smaller signs and billboards, some of which are partially obscured.
- Raised traffic lights or signals, signaling that the road is a busy one.
- A large hill or mountain visible in the background, adding to the scenic backdrop.
- Some electrical or utility poles and wires extending overhead.

Given the setting with sporadic closed shops and hotels, it might suggest a time frame like early morning or low season.

## How To Use This Recipe

### Authentication

When deploying this recipe, you can optionally enable authentication in the container gateway. If you enable
authentication, all requests to your API will need to include your SaladCloud API key in the header `Salad-Api-Key`. See
the [documentation](/products/sce/gateway/sending-requests) for more information about authentication.

### Replica Count

The recipe is configured for 3 replicas by default, and we recommend using at least 3 for testing, and at least 5 for
production workloads. SaladCloud's distributed GPU cloud is powered by idle gaming PCs around the world, in private
residences, gaming cafes, and eSports arenas. A consequence of this unique infrastructure is that all nodes must be
considered interruptible without warning. If a Chef (a compute host) decides they want to use their GPU to play a video
game, or their dog trips on the power cord, or their Wi-Fi goes out, the instance of your workload running on that node
will be interrupted, and a new instance will be allocated to a different node. This means you will want to slightly
over-provision the capacity you expect to need in order to have adequate coverage during node reallocations. Don't
worry, we only charge for instances that are actually running.

### Logging

SaladCloud offers a simple built-in method to view logs from the portal, to facilitate testing and development. For
production workloads, we highly recommend connecting an external logging source, such as Axiom. This can be done during
container group creation.

### Deploy It And Wait

When you deploy the recipe, SaladCloud will find the desired number of qualified nodes, and begin the process of
downloading the container image to the host machine. This particular image is quite large (~13.5 GB), and it may take up
to tens of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network conditions of that particular node. Remember,
these are privately owned pcs with gaming gpus in a variety of networking conditions, and performance will vary across
different nodes.

Eventually, you will see instances enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the “Ready” column, indicating
the workload is passing its readiness probe. Once at least 1 instance is running, the container group will be considered
running, but for production you will want to wait until an adequate number of nodes have become ready before moving
traffic over.

### Visit The Docs

Once at least one instance is running, you can navigate to the `/docs` endpoint at the Access Domain Name provided in
the portal. This will provide you with the Swagger documentation for the API, and allow you to test the API directly
from the documentation.

## API Reference

This is available at the `/docs` endpoint of the Access Domain Name provided in the portal, and also in
[reference documentation](/reference/recipes/qwen2.5-vl-3b-instruct-tgi/generate-tokens-1).
