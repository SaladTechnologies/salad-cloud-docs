## Overview

This recipe deploys the [Qwen2.5 VL 7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) model by Qwen, a
powerful vision-language model from Alibaba. It uses
[Huggingface Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) as an
inference server. The model is capable of generating text from images, and can be used for a variety of tasks such as
image captioning, document question answering, and more.

## Example Output

**Prompt**

What is in this image? Include details.

**Output**

The image depicts a quiet street scene in a town, likely in a Middle Eastern region given the signage and architecture.
Key details include:

- Hotel Signage: Prominently featured is a sign for the “PEACE WAY HOTEL,” indicating hospitality services in the area.
- Restaurant/Cafe: There is another sign labeled “NO NAME RESTAURANT & CAFE,” suggesting local dining options.
- Buildings: The landscape includes low-rise buildings with various signs in different languages (likely Arabic and
  English), displaying shops and businesses.
- Traffic: A few vehicles are visible, including a car on the road, suggesting minimal traffic activity.
- Surroundings: The background displays a mountainous area, suggesting a hilly or dry environment.
- Electrical Wires: The presence of utility poles and wires, indicative of urban infrastructure, adds to the character
  of the streetscape.

Overall, the setting appears to be a small, possibly rural town, characterized by local commerce and quiet surroundings.

## How To Use This Recipe

### Authentication

When deploying this recipe, you can optionally enable authentication in the container gateway. If you enable
authentication, all requests to your API will need to include your SaladCloud API key in the header `Salad-Api-Key`. See
the [documentation](/products/sce/gateway/sending-requests) for more information about authentication.

### Replica Count

The recipe is configured for 3 replicas by default, and we recommend using at least 3 for testing, and at least 5 for
production workloads. SaladCloud's distributed GPU cloud is powered by idle gaming PCs around the world, in private
residences, gaming cafes, and eSports arenas. A consequence of this unique infrastructure is that all nodes must be
considered interruptible without warning. If a Chef (a compute host) decides they want to use their GPU to play a video
game, or their dog trips on the power cord, or their Wi-Fi goes out, the instance of your workload running on that node
will be interrupted, and a new instance will be allocated to a different node. This means you will want to slightly
over-provision the capacity you expect to need in order to have adequate coverage during node reallocations. Don't
worry, we only charge for instances that are actually running.

### Logging

SaladCloud offers a simple built-in method to view logs from the portal, to facilitate testing and development. For
production workloads, we highly recommend connecting an external logging source, such as Axiom. This can be done during
container group creation.

### Deploy It And Wait

When you deploy the recipe, SaladCloud will find the desired number of qualified nodes, and begin the process of
downloading the container image to the host machine. This particular image is quite large (~20.12 GB), and it may take
up to tens of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network conditions of that particular node.
Remember, these are privately owned pcs with gaming gpus in a variety of networking conditions, and performance will
vary across different nodes.

Eventually, you will see instances enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the “Ready” column, indicating
the workload is passing its readiness probe. Once at least 1 instance is running, the container group will be considered
running, but for production you will want to wait until an adequate number of nodes have become ready before moving
traffic over.

### Visit The Docs

Once at least one instance is running, you can navigate to the `/docs` endpoint at the Access Domain Name provided in
the portal. This will provide you with the Swagger documentation for the API, and allow you to test the API directly
from the documentation.

## API Reference

This is available at the `/docs` endpoint of the Access Domain Name provided in the portal, and also in
[reference documentation](/reference/recipes/qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct-tgi/generate-tokens-1).
