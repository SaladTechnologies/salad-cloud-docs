title: Dreamshaper 8 - ComfyUI (API)

_Last Updated: December 04, 2024_

<Tip>Deploy from the [SaladCloud Portal](https://portal.salad.com).</Tip>
<Note>See the [Benchmark](https://blog.salad.com/stable-diffusion-1-5/) for performance information.</Note>

## Overview

This recipe creates an inference API for the [Dreamshaper 8](https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper) image
generation model by Lykon, fine-tuned from
[Stable Diffusion 1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5). Inference is powered by
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/), exposed via
[a simple HTTP API](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api) to facilitate scalable stateless operation. Users
can make an HTTP request to the provided endpoints and get back one or more images in base64 encoded form. Optionally,
users can receive completed images via a webhook.

Dreamshaper 8 is notable for a number of reasons:

- Great quality images, very low hardware requirements
- Supports many different art styles
- Commercial-friendly license

## How To Use This Recipe

### Authentication

When deploying this recipe, you can optionally enable authentication in the container gateway. If you enable
authentication, all requests to your API will need to include your SaladCloud API key in the header `Salad-Api-Key`. See
the [documentation](/products/sce/gateway/sending-requests) for more information about authentication.

### Replica Count

The recipe is configured for 3 replicas by default, and we recommend using at least 3 for testing, and at least 5 for
production workloads. SaladCloud's distributed GPU cloud is powered by idle gaming PCs around the world, in private
residences, gaming cafes, and esports arenas. A consequence of this unique infrastructure is that all nodes must be
considered interruptible without warning. If a Chef (a compute host) decides they want to use their GPU to play a video
game, or their dog trips on the power cord, or their Wi-Fi goes out, the instance of your workload running on that node
will be interrupted, and a new instance will be allocated to a different node. This means you will want to slightly
over-provision the capacity you expect to need in order to have adequate coverage during node reallocations. Don’t
worry, we only charge for instances that are actually running.

### Logging

SaladCloud offers a simple built-in method to view logs from the portal, to facilitate testing and development. For
production workloads, we highly recommend connecting an external logging source, such as Axiom. This can be done during
container group creation.

### Deploy It And Wait

When you deploy the recipe, SaladCloud will find the desired number of qualified nodes, and begin the process of
downloading the container image to the host machine. This image is relatively large (~6 GB), and it may take up to tens
of minutes to download to some machines, depending on the network conditions of that particular node. Remember, these
are residential PCs with residential internet connections, and performance will vary across different nodes.

Eventually, you will see instances enter the running state, and show a green checkmark in the “Ready” column, indicating
the workload is passing its readiness probe. Once at least 1 instance is running, the container group will be considered
running, but for production you will want to wait until an adequate number of nodes have become ready before moving
traffic over.

### Visit The Docs

Once at least one instance is running, you can navigate to the `/docs` endpoint at the Access Domain Name provided in
the portal. In the above example that URL is `https://nectarine-frisee-3lk3jgv5cdo50mso.salad.cloud/docs` . You’ll see
the swagger documentation that looks something like this:

## Workload Customizations

### **Hardware Considerations**

Since this model is fine-tuned from stable diffusion 1.5, it can be run on a wide variety of hardware. We chose the RTX
3060 Ti with 8gb vRAM for the default recipe configuration because it performs well enough for many applications, and is
a very good value. You should run your own performance testing to determine the hardware configuration that is right for
your specific workload.

### Custom Models And Nodes

To use a different model, you would follow
[this guide](/guides/image-generation/basic-how-to-deploy-stable-diffusion-on-salad-comfy) but copy in your custom model
instead of the default one, and ensure your warmup workflow references the correct checkpoint name. You’d push up the
new image to the image registry of your choice, and edit the container group to reference the new image.

### Custom Endpoints

To add custom endpoints or other custom functionality to the API server, you can add javascript or typescript files to
the docker image
[following this example](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-recipes/tree/master/src/dreamshaper8-comfyui).

## API Reference

You can see the full API documentation at the `/docs` endpoint at the Access Domain Name of your container group. They
can also be found in the [API Reference](/reference/recipes/dreamshaper8-comfyui/).
