## What are Recipes?

**Recipes** are pre-configured deployment templates for
[Container Groups](/products/sce/container-groups/container-groups) that make it easy to get started with common
workloads. Each Recipe includes a set of default parameters and configurations that can be deployed as-is or customized
to meet your specific needs.

## How to Use Recipes

Recipes can be deployed from the SaladCloud Portal, from the "Create Container Group" page.

1. **Navigate to the Portal**: Visit [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com) and log in to your account.
2. **Select your Organization**: If you have multiple organizations, select the one where you want to deploy the Recipe.
3. **Select your Project**: If you have multiple projects, select the one where you want to deploy the Recipe.
4. **Navigate to Container Groups**: Click on the "Container Groups" tab in the left-hand navigation.
5. **Create a New Container Group**: Click the "Deploy a Container Group" button.
6. **Choose a Recipe**: Select a Recipe, either from the "Featured" section, or from the "Recipes" section.
7. **Deploy or Customize**: Review the Recipe parameters and configurations, and click "Deploy" to create the Container
   Group. The default configuration is chosen for an optimal experience, but you can customize the Recipe to meet your
   specific requirements, including number of replicas, hardware resources, and more.
8. **Explore the Documentation**: Each recipe has documentation that explains the purpose of the Recipe, how to use it,
   and any additional configuration options. You can also find the API reference for each recipe in
   [Reference](/reference), under the "Recipes" section.
9. **Monitor and Manage**: Once the Container Group is deployed, you can monitor its status and logs from the Portal.
   You can also edit and scale the Container Group as needed, including deploying custom docker images. Dockerfiles and
   configuration for all recipes can be found in the
   [SaladCloud Recipes GitHub repository](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-recipes/tree/master/src).

## Billing

Recipes are billed as standard container groups, based on the amount of time any workload replica is running. For more
information on billing and pricing, see the
[Billing and Pricing](/products/sce/container-groups/billing-and-pricing/billing) section.
