## Introduction

SaladCloud is the world's largest fully distributed cloud, suitable for a wide range of compute-intensive applications,
from generative AI inference to molecular simulations.

Applications on SaladCloud are deployed as docker containers, scaled out horizontally to idle compute resources from
SaladCloud's network of millions of devices. This allows SaladCloud to offer the most
[competitive pricing](https://salad.com/pricing) in the industry, while providing the flexibility to scale up or down as
needed.

SaladCloud is comprised of million of privately owned devices, primarily gaming PCs, running the SaladCloud agent. When
these devices are not in use by their owners, SaladCloud assigns containers to run on them, paying the device owner for
their compute time. You can think of it like AirBnB for compute.

and privacy for both device owners and container operators.
