## Introduction

SaladCloud is the world's largest fully distributed cloud, suitable for a wide range of compute-intensive applications,
from generative AI inference to molecular simulations.

Applications on SaladCloud are deployed as Docker containers and scaled horizontally across idle compute resources from
SaladCloud's network of millions of devices. This allows SaladCloud to offer some of the most
[competitive pricing](https://salad.com/pricing) in the industry while providing flexible scaling to meet your needs.

SaladCloud's network is comprised of millions of privately owned devices, primarily gaming PCs, running the SaladCloud
agent. When these devices are idle, SaladCloud assigns containers to run on them, compensating device owners for their
compute time. Think of it as AirBnB for compute. [Learn more about how SaladCloud works](/products/sce/introduction),
and how we ensure [security](https://salad.com/security) and privacy for both device owners and container operators.
