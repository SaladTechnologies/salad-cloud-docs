### Why did I receive an email from SaladCloud that I did not request?

SaladCloud provides various forms asking for email addresses to help customers resolve login issues, such as our password reset workflow. 
It's possible that someone else typed in your email address by accident. When this happens, you'll receive an email from Salad with a one-time 
link to reset your password.

### What do I do when I receive an email from SaladCloud that I did not request?

If you receive an email from SaladCloud that you did not request, do not click on any links within the email. Instead, navigate directly to 
the SaladCloud Portal and log in to your account. Check your account settings and recent activity for any suspicious changes. If you notice 
anything unusual, immediately change your password and [contact SaladCloud support](mailto:cloud@salad.com) to report the incident.

### How do I ensure my SaladCloud account and organization information are secure?

Here are some tips to safeguard your account:

- Ensure your email is secure by using a strong password and regularly updating it.
- Use a long, random password with a minimum of 8 characters, including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid reusing the same password across multiple sites to minimize the risk of breaches.
