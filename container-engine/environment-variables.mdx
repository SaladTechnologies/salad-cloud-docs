title: "Using Environment Variables"
---

Environment variables are key-value pairs that can be used to configure and customize the behaviour of server running inside a container. These variables are accessible to processes running within the container and are commonly used to store configuration settings, credentials, and other runtime information.

In Salad Portal, you can set environment variables for your containers by providing a key-value pair. The "**key**" represents the name of the environment variable, and the "**value**" represents its associated data.

> Note that there are several environment variables that are always passed to, and accessible from, the container:
>
> **SALAD_MACHINE_ID** is the ID of the machine the particular container instance is running on.  
> **SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID** is the ID of the entire container group.  
> **HOSTNAME**

## **Using Environment Variables in Salad Portal**

To use environment variables in Salad Portal, follow these steps:

If you haven't already, create a new container group. Please refer to our separate documentation on "[How to Create a Container](/container-engine/deploy-containers)" for detailed instructions on this step.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In the container group creation or configuration process, locate the "Environment Variables" section in Optional Settings and click on the "Edit" button.
