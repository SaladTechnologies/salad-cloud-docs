title: "Specifying a command"
---

Providing “command” overrides the ENTRYPOINT and CMD of a container image, similar to the CLI `docker run --entrypoint` flag.

The first item in command is executed as the entrypoint, and subsequent items are provided as arguments.

Note that if a command is specified, any ENTRYPOINT and CMD set in the dockerfile are overridden. If needed, `command` can be used to add additional arguments to a container, by including the existing CMD or ENTRYPOINT of the image.

As an example, running `docker run --entrypoint /bin/test mycontainer:latest arg1 arg2 arg3` would correspond to the salad command of

```
[
      "/bin/test",
      "arg1",
      "arg2",
      "arg3"
]
```

> 🚧 Caution
>
> Specifying a command overrides the CMD and ENTRYPOINT from your dockerfile. This should only be used if you want to override what is already in your dockerfile.
>
> This is not synonymous with `docker run`.
