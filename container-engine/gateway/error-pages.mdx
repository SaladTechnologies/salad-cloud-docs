When the Container Gateway is configured for a container group, it will be assigned an Access Domain Name URL. If you try to access that URL in your browser, and encounter an error, we provide error messaging to help you understand the nature of the error. Errors can occur, for example, when a container has not been fully set up yet, or has failed.
