### Step 4: Configure the Container Group

1. On the configuration page, enter a name for your container group.
2. Provide the Docker image, for example `docker.io/saladtechnologies/demo-image:0.1`
3. Specify the number of replicas (e.g., "5") that you want to deploy

4. Scroll down to the "Resource" section and choose the required vCPU, memory size needed for your container.

5. After configuring the CPU and memory settings, scroll down to the GPU Selection section. You have the option to select a single GPU class or multiple GPU classes for their workload, or even choose all available GPU classes if needed.

This estimation helps users understand the cost implications of their GPU selection.

### Step 5: Deploy the Container Group and Additional Configuration

1. **(Optional) **Customize your container by exploring optional features like the Container Gateway, External Logging Service, and Environment Variables. Apply these settings according to your specific needs.
2. Once you've completed the configuration, click "Deploy" to initiate the container deployment process.
