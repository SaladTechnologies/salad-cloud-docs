Salad Cloud simplifies container deployment, allowing you to easily manage containers within your organization. In this
step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of deploying a container using the Salad Cloud Portal. Let's
get started!

### Step 1: Log in to the Salad Cloud Portal

1. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the [Salad Cloud Portal](https://portal.salad.com).
2. Enter your login credentials (username and password) to access your account dashboard.

### Step 2: Create a new Organization and Project

1. Within the dashboard, click on the "Create New Organization" button. (This assumes you're not already part of an
   organization that you've been invited to)

   Group" from the options presented.

### Step 4: Configure the Container Group with the Set Up Wizard

1. On the configuration page, enter a name for your container group.
2. Provide the image name and source.
3. Specify the number of replicas (e.g., "5") that you want to deploy
4. Optional : Specify Environmental Variables or Commands

5. Choose your machine hardware on the next page. You will be prompted to chose vCPU, memory size and GPU class. You can
   choose more than one GPU class if necessary.

   When users select multiple GPU classes, SaladCloud provides a estimated cost that reflects a range from the cheapest
   to the most expensive GPU selected within the chosen classes. This estimation helps users understand the cost
   implications of their GPU selection.

6. Configure your container connections. Note that the Container Gateway cannot be enabled after your container
   deployment is live.
