## How to Log From Your Container

When running a container on SaladCloud, you can log to the standard output and standard error streams. These logs are
collected and stored by SaladCloud, and exported to any configured
[external logging source](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/external-logging).

## General Best Practices

- **Use Structured Logging**: Whenever possible, use structured logging (JSON format) instead of unstructured logging
  (plain text). This makes it easier to query and analyze your logs. This is supported by all major logging frameworks.
- **Include Contextual Information**: Include relevant metadata in your logs, such as user IDs, request IDs, and
  timestamps. This information can be invaluable for troubleshooting issues.
- **Log at the Appropriate Level**: Use the appropriate log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) for each log message.
  This helps to filter and prioritize logs during analysis.
- **Avoid Logging Sensitive Information**: Be mindful of the data you log. Avoid logging sensitive information, such as
  passwords or personal data, to protect user privacy and comply with regulations.

## Querying Logs

- **Familiarize Yourself with the Query Language**: Take the time to
  [learn the query language](/container-engine/reference/log-queries) used for searching logs. Understanding the syntax
  and available operators will help you craft effective queries.
- **Use Filters Wisely**: Use filters to narrow down your search results. This can include filtering by time range, log
  level, or specific metadata fields.

## Integrating with External Logging Tools

- **Choose the Right Tool**: When integrating with external logging tools, choose a tool that fits your needs in terms
  of features, scalability, and cost.
- **Use Webhooks for Real-Time Logging**: If your external logging tool supports webhooks, consider using them for
  real-time log forwarding.
- **Monitor Your Logging Integration**: Keep an eye on your logging integration to ensure logs are being forwarded
  correctly and to identify any potential issues.

## Logging Libraries

When implementing logging in your applications, consider using established logging libraries that support structured
logging and can easily integrate with SaladCloud's logging infrastructure. Some popular logging libraries include:

- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) (Node.js): A versatile logging library for Node.js applications that
  supports multiple transports and structured logging.
- [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) (Python): A structured logging library for Python that makes it easy
  to log contextual information.

These libraries can help you implement best practices for logging and make it easier to integrate with external logging
tools.

When using these libraries with SaladCloud, configure them to use the field `severity` to indicate log level, rather
than `level`. This will cause the field to get indexed more efficiently by Salad's logging backend.

### `winston` Examples

```javascript
const { createLogger, format, transports } = require('winston')

const jsonFormat = format.combine(
  format((info) => {
    // Assign the 'level' value to a new 'severity' property
    info.severity = info.level
    // Delete the original 'level' property
    delete info.level
    return info
  })(),
  format.json(),
)

const logger = createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: jsonFormat,
  transports: [new transports.Console()],
})

logger.info('Hello, world!')
// {"message":"Hello, world!","severity":"info"}

logger.error('Something went wrong!')
// {"message":"Something went wrong!","severity":"error"}

logger.warn('This is a warning!', { additional: 'metadata' })
// {"additional":"metadata","message":"This is a warning!","severity":"warn"}
```

### `structlog` Examples

```python
import structlog


def rename_level_to_severity(logger, name, event_dict):
    if "level" in event_dict:
        event_dict["severity"] = event_dict.pop("level")
    return event_dict

structlog.configure(
    processors=[structlog.stdlib.add_log_level, rename_level_to_severity, structlog.processors.JSONRenderer()]
)
logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info("Hello, world!")
# {"event": "Hello, world!", "severity": "info"}

logger.error("Something went wrong!")
# {"event": "Something went wrong!", "severity": "error"}

logger.warn("This is a warning!", additional="metadata")
# {"additional": "metadata", "event": "This is a warning!", "severity": "warning"}
```
