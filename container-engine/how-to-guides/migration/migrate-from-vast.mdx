_Last Updated: July 18, 2025_

# Overview

Migrating from Vast.ai to SaladCloud is a straightforward process that preserves your existing development workflow
while automating the operational complexity you're used to managing manually. If you're currently SSH-ing into
instances, installing dependencies, and running scripts on Vast.ai, you'll find that SaladCloud maintains the same
familiar patterns—your Python code, ML frameworks, and data processing logic remain identical.

**What Stays Exactly the Same:**

- Your application code and algorithms work unchanged
- Same Python libraries, PyTorch/TensorFlow frameworks, and CUDA operations
- Identical API patterns, data processing workflows, and model training approaches
- Same debugging mindset—just with better tools in addition to SSH
- Your development environment and local testing process

**What Gets Automated for You:** Instead of manually managing GPU instances, SaladCloud handles instance provisioning,
CUDA driver installation, framework setup, automatic failover, and global load balancing through our
[Salad Container Engine (SCE)](/container-engine/explanation/core-concepts/overview). The "migration" is really about
packaging your existing workflow into a container that runs your familiar code automatically across 11,000+ GPUs while
saving up to 90% on costs.

Think of containerization as creating a "recipe" for the manual setup you already do on Vast.ai—instead of SSH-ing in
and running `pip install` commands each time, you write those same commands once in a Dockerfile, Docker builds an
immutable image with everything pre-installed, and that same image runs consistently across all instances. Most
developers find this eliminates their biggest frustrations with manual instance management while keeping everything else
familiar.

## Why Containerization Has Become the Industry Standard

Containerization has emerged as the de facto deployment standard across the technology industry for compelling reasons
that directly benefit developers and organizations. Containers provide **consistency across environments** by packaging
applications with all their dependencies, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem that has plagued software
deployment for decades. This consistency extends from development laptops to production clusters, ensuring predictable
behavior regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

The **portability** offered by containers is transformative—applications become truly platform-agnostic, running
identically on any system that supports container runtimes. This portability reduces vendor lock-in and enables
organizations to migrate workloads between cloud providers, on-premises infrastructure, or hybrid environments without
code changes. Additionally, containers enable **efficient resource utilization** through consistent packaging and
deployment, while SaladCloud's architecture ensures each container gets dedicated access to full GPU resources on
individual nodes.

Perhaps most importantly, containers have revolutionized **deployment velocity and reliability**. Teams can package,
test, and deploy applications in minutes rather than hours, while container orchestration platforms provide automatic
scaling, health monitoring, and self-healing capabilities. This operational efficiency has made containerization
essential for modern DevOps practices and continuous delivery pipelines.

On SaladCloud, each container runs on a dedicated GPU node, ensuring your application has exclusive access to the full
GPU resources without sharing with other workloads. This dedicated approach maximizes performance while maintaining the
portability and consistency benefits of containerization.

## Key Platform Differences

### Vast.ai Architecture

- Individual GPU instances with SSH access
- VM-like environment with direct file system access
- Instance-based pricing and management

### SaladCloud Architecture

- Containerized applications with automatic orchestration
- Distributed network with built-in redundancy
- Container-based deployment with health monitoring

## Migration Requirements

### What You're Already Doing (Made Easier)

The "requirements" below are actually improvements to processes you're already handling manually on Vast.ai. Rather than
learning entirely new concepts, you're automating existing workflows with better consistency and reliability.

- **Containerization** replaces manual dependency installation on each instance. Instead of SSH-ing in and running the
  same `pip install` commands repeatedly, you write them once in a Dockerfile, Docker builds the dependencies into an
  immutable image, and that image runs consistently across all instances. You still have SSH access for debugging via
  the web terminal or traditional SSH post deployment.

- **Storage Strategy** shifts from local file management to cloud-based storage patterns. While cloud APIs provide more
  reliable data persistence than manually copying files between instances, this transition requires rethinking data
  workflows. You'll need to consider upload/download costs, latency impacts, and potential network reliability issues
  that weren't factors with local storage on Vast.ai.

- **Network Architecture** replaces managing multiple ports and SSH tunneling. You get a single port with automatic load
  balancing instead of manually configuring port forwarding and access rules.

- **AMD64 Architecture** is what you're already using on most Vast.ai instances, so this requires no change to your
  existing applications.

### Technical Implementation (Familiar Concepts)

These constraints map directly to what you're already working with, just more consistently managed:

- **Container Images**: 35GB limit (larger than most Vast.ai instance setups)
- **Storage**: Cloud-based (eliminates instance storage limitations) - see our
  [storage integration guide](/storage/explanation/overview) for persistent data patterns
- **Networking**: [IPv6 support](/container-engine/how-to-guides/gateway/enabling-ipv6) (replace `0.0.0.0` with `::` in
  your bind address)
- **Debugging**: [Web terminal](/container-engine/tutorials/development-tools/interactive-terminal),
  [SSH access](/container-engine/explanation/container-groups/ssh-and-terminal) and
  [portal logs](/container-engine/explanation/container-groups/container-logs)

> 📘 **Container Registry Options:** SaladCloud supports all major container registries. See our guides for
> [Docker Hub](/container-engine/how-to-guides/registries/dockerhub),
> [AWS ECR](/container-engine/how-to-guides/registries/aws-ecr),
> [Azure ACR](/container-engine/how-to-guides/registries/azure-acr), and
> [Google Artifact Registry](/container-engine/how-to-guides/registries/gcp-gar).

## Migration Process

All deployment and management tasks described in this guide can be accomplished through the intuitive SaladCloud web
portal at [portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com) or programmatically via our REST API and SDKs (Python and
TypeScript). The portal provides a visual interface perfect for getting started and one-off deployments, while the API
and SDKs enable automation, CI/CD integration, and infrastructure-as-code workflows. You can seamlessly switch between
approaches—deploy through the portal initially, then automate with the API as your needs grow.

### Phase 1: Assessment and Containerization

**Assessment and Planning**

- Catalog your current Vast.ai workloads
- Identify containerization candidates
- Set up SaladCloud account and API access

**Container Development**

- Create Dockerfiles for your applications
- Build and test containers locally
- Push images to container registry

> 🔧 **Containerization Resources:** If you're new to Docker, check out our
> [Docker deployment tutorial](/container-engine/tutorials/deployment/docker-run) for practical examples, or see
> [specifying container commands](/container-engine/how-to-guides/specifying-a-command) for advanced startup
> configuration.

### Phase 2: Deployment and Optimization

**Initial Deployment**

- Deploy containers to SaladCloud (via portal or API)
- Configure Container Gateway and health probes
- Set up monitoring and logging

> 📊 **Monitoring & Logging:** For production workloads, consider setting up
> [external logging](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/external-logging) with providers like
> [Axiom](/container-engine/how-to-guides/external-logging/axiom) (recommended),
> [Datadog](/container-engine/how-to-guides/external-logging/datadog), or
> [New Relic](/container-engine/how-to-guides/external-logging/new-relic) for advanced log analysis and retention.

**Testing and Optimization**

- Validate performance and functionality
- Optimize resource allocation (containers have CPU/memory limits, not direct hardware allocation like VMs)
- Complete migration of remaining workloads

**Understanding Container vs VM Resource Models**

Unlike Vast.ai VMs where you get dedicated hardware specs (e.g., "8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM"), SaladCloud containers specify
resource limits. Your container can use up to the specified CPU and memory limits, but the underlying node architecture
may vary. This means:

- **CPU Limits**: Your container gets guaranteed access up to the specified vCPU count, but performance characteristics
  may differ across node types
- **Memory Limits**: Hard limits enforced by the container runtime - exceeding these will terminate your container
- **GPU Access**: Each container gets exclusive access to the full GPU on its assigned node
- **Storage**: Container filesystem is ephemeral - data doesn't persist between container restarts unless using external
  storage

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your SaladCloud Environment

**Account Setup**

1. Create account at [portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
2. Set up organization and project
3. Add billing information and initial credits
4. Generate API key for programmatic access

**Environment Configuration**

```bash
# Use SaladCloud API directly or Python SDK
curl -X GET "https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/your-org/projects/your-project/containers" \
  -H "Salad-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Python SDK Installation**

```bash
pip install salad-cloud-sdk
```

**Python SDK Usage**

```python
from salad_cloud_sdk import SaladCloudSdk

# Initialize SDK
sdk = SaladCloudSdk(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# List container groups
result = sdk.container_groups.list_container_groups(
    organization_name="your-org",
    project_name="your-project"
)
```

For complete API documentation, see the [SaladCloud API Reference](/reference/saladcloud-api).

### Step 2: Containerize Your Applications

**Understanding Containerization for Vast.ai Users** If you're coming from Vast.ai without container experience, think
of containerization as creating a "blueprint" for your application environment. Instead of manually installing
dependencies on each GPU instance, you define everything your application needs in a simple text file called a
Dockerfile. The key difference is that containers provide environment consistency - when your container image is
deployed across multiple SaladCloud nodes, each instance runs in an identical environment that was defined at build
time.

**No More Manual Environment Setup** One of the biggest advantages of containerization is that complex environments like
PyTorch with CUDA are available as pre-built, officially maintained images. Remember the frustration of manually
configuring CUDA drivers, PyTorch versions, and dependency conflicts on Vast.ai? That's completely eliminated with
containers.

Instead of spending time on environment setup, you can start with battle-tested base images:

```dockerfile
# Pre-built PyTorch with latest CUDA support - no manual setup required
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.6-cudnn9-runtime

# Or NVIDIA's optimized PyTorch container with CUDA 12.6
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3

# Or a general CUDA base for custom ML stacks
FROM nvidia/cuda:12.6-cudnn9-runtime-ubuntu22.04
```

These images come with:

- ✅ CUDA drivers pre-installed and configured
- ✅ cuDNN libraries properly linked
- ✅ Framework-specific optimizations
- ✅ Compatible Python environments
- ✅ All dependencies tested together

> ⚡ **GPU Compatibility:** SaladCloud guarantees support for CUDA Toolkit 12.0 and later. For the latest RTX 5090/5080
> GPUs, see our [PyTorch RTX 5090 guide](/container-engine/tutorials/machine-learning/pytorch-rtx5090) for CUDA 12.8
> requirements. Check our
> [high-performance applications guide](/container-engine/tutorials/performance/high-performance-apps) for GPU
> optimization tips.

**Basic Containerization Pattern** The Dockerfile below shows how straightforward containerization can be. Notice how it
mirrors the same steps you'd typically perform on a Vast.ai instance:

```dockerfile
# Start with a pre-built PyTorch+CUDA image (no manual CUDA setup!)
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.6-cudnn9-runtime

WORKDIR /app

# Install additional dependencies (same as pip install on Vast.ai)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code (same as uploading your files)
COPY . .

# Start application with IPv6 support (same as running python app.py)
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "::", "--port", "8000"]
```

**What's Familiar:**

- **Dependencies**: The `pip install` line works exactly like on Vast.ai
- **File Structure**: Your code organization remains the same
- **Startup Command**: The CMD line replaces what you'd type in your Vast.ai terminal
- **Environment Variables**: Still work the same way in containers

**What's Better:**

- **No CUDA Setup**: Skip the tedious CUDA/PyTorch installation process entirely
- **Consistent Environments**: Your exact environment runs identically across all nodes
- **Version Control**: Pin specific framework versions without compatibility issues
- **IPv6 Ready**: Use `::` instead of `0.0.0.0` for Container Gateway compatibility

**Building Your Container**

```bash
# Build your container (replaces manual setup)
docker build -t your-ml-app:latest .

# Push to registry (replaces copying files to instances)
docker push your-registry/your-ml-app:latest
```

The beauty of this approach is that you're essentially automating the same setup process you'd do manually on Vast.ai,
but with better consistency and portability—plus you never have to deal with CUDA installation headaches again.

**Storage Integration Example**

```python
# Replace local file operations with cloud storage
import boto3
import requests
import tempfile
import os

# For persistent data: Use external cloud storage (S3)
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def store_data_s3(data, bucket, key):
    """Store data in S3 for persistent storage"""
    s3_client.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=data)
    return f"s3://{bucket}/{key}"

def load_data_s3(bucket, key):
    """Load data from S3"""
    response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    return response['Body'].read()

# For processing: Use in-memory or temporary local storage
def process_data(input_data):
    """Process data using temporary storage"""
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp_file:
        tmp_file.write(input_data)
        tmp_file.flush()
        # Process the temporary file
        # File is automatically cleaned up when context exits
        return processed_data

# Example usage in application
def main():
    # Load persistent data from S3
    model_data = load_data_s3('my-models', 'trained_model.safetensors')

    # Use temporary local storage for processing
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp:
        tmp.write(model_data)
        result = process_model(tmp.name)

    # Store final results back to S3
    store_data_s3(result, 'my-results', 'final_output.json')
```

**Important Storage Considerations**

While cloud storage offers better reliability than local files, the transition requires careful planning:

- **Latency Impact**: Network calls to cloud storage are slower than local file access. Consider caching frequently
  accessed data locally during processing.
- **Bandwidth Costs**: Large model downloads/uploads can be expensive. Evaluate if you need to transfer full datasets or
  can work with smaller chunks.
- **Error Handling**: Network operations can fail. Implement retry logic and graceful degradation for storage
  operations.
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple container instances may access the same data. Consider read/write patterns and
  potential conflicts.

**What Changes:**

- `open('/path/to/file.txt', 'r')` becomes `load_data_s3('bucket', 'file.txt')`
- `with open('/path/to/file.txt', 'w')` becomes `store_data_s3(data, 'bucket', 'file.txt')`
- File paths become bucket keys (still organized hierarchically)

**What Stays the Same:**

- Your data processing logic is identical
- Error handling patterns remain familiar
- File formats and serialization work exactly as before
- Temporary processing still uses local files when needed

**Benefits You Gain:**

- **Reliability**: No more lost data when containers restart—your models and results persist
- **Scalability**: Access the same data from multiple containers simultaneously
- **Collaboration**: Share datasets and models across your team instantly
- **Backup**: Built-in redundancy and versioning (with S3) eliminates data loss concerns
- **Performance**: Often faster than local disk I/O, especially for large files
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for storage you use, not for reserved disk space

This approach actually simplifies deployment because you eliminate the complexity of managing persistent volumes, file
permissions, and disk space—challenges that often plague traditional GPU instance setups.

### Step 3: Deploy Container Groups

**Portal Deployment (Recommended for first deployment)**

1. Navigate to your SaladCloud project
2. Click "Create Container Group"
3. Configure container settings:
   - Image: Your container registry URL
   - Replicas: Start with 2-3 for reliability
   - Resources: CPU, RAM, and GPU requirements
   - Container Gateway: Enable for external access

For a complete deployment walkthrough, see the [Quickstart Tutorial](/container-engine/tutorials/quickstart).

**API Deployment Example**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/$ORG/projects/$PROJECT/containers" \
  -H "Salad-Api-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-workload",
    "container": {
      "image": "myregistry/myapp:latest",
      "resources": {
        "cpu": 2,
        "memory": 4096,
        "gpu_classes": ["rtx4090", "rtx3090"]
      }
    },
    "networking": {
      "protocol": "http",
      "port": 8000,
      "auth": false
    },
    "replicas": 3,
    "restart_policy": "always"
  }'
```

### Step 4: Configure Health Monitoring

**Health Probe Implementation**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": datetime.utcnow()}

@app.get("/ready")
async def readiness_check():
    # Check if app is ready to receive traffic
    return {"status": "ready"}

@app.get("/started")
async def startup_check():
    # Check if app has started successfully
    return {"status": "started"}
```

**Configure Health Probes in SaladCloud** Health probes are configured through the SaladCloud portal or API, not through
Dockerfile directives:

- **Startup Probe**: Configure HTTP probe pointing to `/started` endpoint
- **Liveness Probe**: Configure HTTP probe pointing to `/health` endpoint
- **Readiness Probe**: Configure HTTP probe pointing to `/ready` endpoint

For detailed information on health probes, see the
[Health Probes documentation](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/health-probes).

> 🏥 **Health Monitoring Deep Dive:** Explore specific probe types:
>
> - [Startup probes](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/startup-probes) - verify container
>   initialization
> - [Readiness probes](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/readiness-probes) - control traffic routing
> - [Liveness probes](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/liveness-probes) - detect and restart
>   unhealthy containers
> - [Health probe in general](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/health-probes) - practical
>   implementation patterns

**Health Probe Configuration**

```python
# Example: SDK configuration for health probes
from salad_cloud_sdk.models import ContainerGroupCreationRequest

request = ContainerGroupCreationRequest(
    # ... other configuration
    startup_probe={
        "http": {
            "path": "/started",
            "port": 8000,
            "scheme": "http"
        },
        "initial_delay_seconds": 10,
        "period_seconds": 5,
        "timeout_seconds": 3,
        "failure_threshold": 3
    },
    liveness_probe={
        "http": {
            "path": "/health",
            "port": 8000,
            "scheme": "http"
        },
        "initial_delay_seconds": 30,
        "period_seconds": 10,
        "timeout_seconds": 5,
        "failure_threshold": 3
    },
    readiness_probe={
        "http": {
            "path": "/ready",
            "port": 8000,
            "scheme": "http"
        },
        "initial_delay_seconds": 5,
        "period_seconds": 5,
        "timeout_seconds": 3,
        "failure_threshold": 3
    }
)
```

### Step 5: Set Up Monitoring and Logging

**Application Logging**

```python
import logging
import sys
import json

# Configure JSON logging for better parsing
class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def format(self, record):
        return json.dumps({
            "timestamp": record.created,
            "level": record.levelname,
            "message": record.getMessage(),
            "module": record.module
        })

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)],
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

**External Logging (Optional)** Configure external logging providers like Axiom through the SaladCloud portal for
advanced log analysis and retention beyond the 90-day portal limit.

> 📋 **Logging Solutions:** Choose from multiple external logging providers:

- **Reliability**: Automatic failover and load balancing
- **Simplicity**: Managed container orchestration
- **Flexibility**: Per-second billing with no long-term commitments

The containerization process, while requiring initial effort, results in more portable, scalable, and maintainable
applications. Most teams find their deployment workflow is significantly improved after migration, with better
monitoring, automatic scaling, and simplified operations.
