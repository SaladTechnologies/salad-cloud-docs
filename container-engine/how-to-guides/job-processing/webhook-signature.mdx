# Validating Webhook Signatures

When using the Salad Job Queue API, you can set up webhooks to receive the output of your jobs. To ensure the integrity
and authenticity of the webhook payloads, you can validate the signatures included in the webhook requests.

A webhook request will include headers `webhook-signature`, `webhook-id` and `webhook-timestamp`, which contains a
signature of the payload. This signature can be validated using your webhook secret key, available in the portal, and
the `svix` library.

## Validating the Signature

### Node.js Example

First, install `svix`:

```bash
npm install svix
```

Then, you can use the following code to validate the signature:

```javascript
const { Webhook } = require('svix')

//Express.js middleware
function validateWebhookSignature(req, res, next) {
  const webhook = new Webhook(secret)
  try {
    webhook.verify(req.body, req.headers)
    next()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', error)
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature')
  }
}
```

### Python Example

First, install `svix`:

```bash
pip install svix
```

Then, you can use the following code to validate the signature:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from svix import Webhook
from typing import Any, Dict

async def validate_webhook(request: Request) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    FastAPI Dependency to validate webhook signatures
    """
    try:
        # Get the raw body
        body = await request.body()

        # Create webhook instance
        webhook = Webhook(webhook_secret)

        # Verify the webhook signature
        payload = webhook.verify(body, dict(request.headers))

        return payload
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Webhook verification failed: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid webhook signature")
```
