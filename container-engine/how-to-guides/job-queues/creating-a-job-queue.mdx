# Using the Public API

Job Queues are not available through the portal, but you can create a Job Queue with the
[Job Queue API](/reference/saladcloud-api/queues/create-queue). You will also need to
[create your container group](/reference/saladcloud-api/container-groups/create-container-group) via the public API in
order to attach a job queue to it.
[Ensure your container image includes the job queue worker](/container-engine/how-to-guides/job-queues/queue-worker)

> A Job Queue can be connected to multiple container groups at once. but a container group can only be connected to at
> most a single Job Queue.

**We recommend adding a [readiness probe](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/readiness-probes) to your
container deployment**. This probe will allow your replica to announce to the Job Queue Service when it's ready to
receive and process jobs. We recommend using it in conjunction with a startup probe. Readiness probes will start to run
after a startup probe succeeds. Without a startup or readiness probe, the Job Queue Worker will immediately start to
look for jobs, even if your application inside is not yet ready to receive jobs. If this happens, the job will fail and
youâ€™ll need to submit it again.

How the readiness probe is configured will depend on your container image, and how itâ€™s configured inside. Many prebuilt
containers or http-apps found in open-source libraries will have a liveness API URL you can check, that will respond
with a 200 code when itâ€™s ready to receive work. Other times, any pre-requisite work may be done before the server
starts, and the server starts up as the last step, so any health-check endpoint would work. In a Whisper Large v3
example below, this is what we have. If your container does not contain a way to check health statuses, you may need to
add one of your own. You can usually find any references to this in the readme or documentation for the container image
you are using. Readiness probes can flip between passing and failing, and will continue to check until itâ€™s ready to go.
