_Last Updated: October 10, 2024_

## Introduction

Truss is a Python library that simplifies the deployment of machine learning models by creating containerized models
that can be served via HTTP requests. This guide will show you how to deploy a Truss container to
**[SaladCloud Portal ](http://portal.salad.com)** and **[SaladCloud API](/reference/api-usage)** so that your model can
be accessed from anywhere.

Prerequisites Before you begin, you will need the following:

- A [SaladCloud account](http://portal.salad.com)
- A project in SaladCloud
- A container image built using [Truss](https://truss.baseten.co/)
- The Truss library installed.

Truss requires Python >=3.7 and \<3.11. To install Truss from PyPi, To install Truss, run this command:

```shell
pip install truss
```

Here is a complete [guide and docs to guide you through Truss](https://truss.baseten.co)

## Step 1: Obtain Your API Key

To authenticate your API requests, you'll need an API key. To obtain your API key, follow these steps:

- Log in to your SaladCloud account at [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
- Click on your profile in the top right corner of the page, then click API Key.
- Copy the API key that is displayed. You'll need this in the next step.

## Step 2: Package Your Model

Before deploying your model to SaladCloud Portal and API, you need to package it as a Truss container. Follow these
steps:

- Install the required dependencies for your model. For example, if you used `scikit-learn` to create your model, run:
  `pip install --upgrade scikit-learn truss`
- Create your model using the Truss library. For example, if you used `scikit-learn` to create your model, run the
  following code:

```python
import truss
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the iris data set
iris = load_iris()
data_x = iris['data']
data_y = iris['target']

# Train the model
rfc = RandomForestClassifier()
rfc.fit(data_x, data_y)

# Create the Truss (serializing & packaging model)
tr = truss.create(rfc, target_directory="iris_rfc_truss")
```

- Serve your model locally using Docker by running:

```shell
truss run-image iris_rfc_truss.
```

The container will start running on port `8080.`

- Ensure that the container is running, then invoke the model as an API using a POST request:

```shell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models/model:predict -d '{"inputs": [[0, 0, 0, 0]]}'
```

- Configure Your Model for Deployment : To configure your Truss, include a file **config.yaml** in the root directory of
  your Truss. Configuration is optional, as every configurable value has a sensible default. The Truss we generated in
  the quickstart sample provides a good example of a typical Truss config:

```yaml
model_framework: sklearn
model_metadata:
  model_binary_dir: model
  supports_predict_proba: true
python_version: py39
requirements:
  - scikit-learn==1.0.2
  - threadpoolctl==3.0.0
  - joblib==1.1.0
  - numpy==1.20.3
  - scipy==1.7.3
```

- Create a Docker image for your Truss model by following the steps outlined in the
  [Quickstart: making a Truss" section of the Truss documentation guide](https://truss.baseten.co/). Make sure to
  replace "iris_rfc_truss" with a name that reflects your model.

- Upload your container to Dockerhub First, ensure that you have a DockerHub account. If you don't, create one at
  [https://hub.docker.com/signup](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

- Next, create a Docker image for your Truss model. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal
  or command prompt:

- Build the Docker image by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
docker build -t <image-name> <path-to-Dockerfile>
```

- Replace `<image-name>` with a name for your Docker image and `<path-to-Dockerfile>` with the path to the directory
  containing your Dockerfile.

- Once the build process is complete, you can push the image to DockerHub by running the following command:

```shell
docker push <your_username>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

- Test your Docker image by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your_username>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

- This should start the Truss container and make it available at http\://localhost:8080.

- Stop the running Docker container by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Container Image to SaladCloud Portal.

Follow this step-by-step guide to deploy a container to
[SaladCloud Portal here](/container-engine/tutorials/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-a-truss-container-to-salad-portal-and-api)

## Step 4: Deploy the Container Image to SaladCloud API

To deploy your container image to SaladCloud API, follow these steps:

- Send a POST request to the following URL:

```http
https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers
```

Replace `organization_name}` and `{project_name}` with the name of your organization and project, respectively.

- In the headers of the POST request, include `accept: application/json` and `content-type: application/json`.
- In the body of the POST request, include the following JSON data, replacing `{API_KEY}` with your SaladCloud API key
  and `{CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL}` with the URL of your container image:

```json
{
  "authorization_token": "{API_KEY}",
  "name": "{CONTAINER_NAME}",
  "image_url": "{CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL}"
}
```

- Send a POST request using `curl`

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/organization_name/projects/project_name/containers \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
     "networking": {
          "protocol": "http"
     }
}
```

- Check the status of the deployment by sending a GET request to the following URL:

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/organization_name/projects/project_name/containers/container_group_name \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

Congratulations, You have successfully deployed a Truss container to SaladCloud Portal and API! Remember to configure
your Truss as needed for deployment and update it regularly. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, don't
hesitate to reach out to the [SaladCloud support team](Mailto:cloud@salad.com).
