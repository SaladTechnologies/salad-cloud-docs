## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An account with SaladCloud . If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for a free trial at
  [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
- A project in SaladCloud . If you don't have a project yet, you can create one by following the instructions in the
  SaladCloud documentation.
- A container image that you want to deploy. If you don't have a container image yet, you can build one using a tool
  like [Docker.](https://www.docker.com/)

## Step 1: Obtain Your API Key

To authenticate your API requests, you'll need an API key. To obtain your API key, follow these steps:

- Log in to your SaladCloud account at [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
- Click on your profile in the top right corner of the page, then click API Access.
- Copy the API key that is displayed. You'll need this in the next step.

## Step 2: Deploy the Container Image

To deploy a container group using the SaladCloud Public API, you'll need to send a POST request with specific parameters
inside the data field along with headers. Here's how to do it:

Send a POST request to the following URL:

```
https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers
```

Replace `{organization_name}` and `{project_name}` with the name of your organization and project, respectively.

Include the following headers in your request:

- `Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}`
- `accept: application/json`
- `content-type: application/json`

Include a JSON payload in the data field of the request body with the necessary configuration parameters. Here's an
example using curl:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers \
     --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "name": "demo-test",
       "display_name": "Demo Test",
       "container": {
         "image": "{CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL}",
         "resources": {
           "cpu": 1,
           "memory": 2048,
           "gpu_classes": [
             "ed563892-aacd-40f5-80b7-90c9be6c759b",
             "a5db5c50-cbcb-4596-ae80-6a0c8090d80f",
             "9998fe42-04a5-4807-b3a5-849943f16c38"
           ]
         }
       },
       "autostart_policy": false,
       "restart_policy": "always",
       "replicas": 1,
       "country_codes": ["af"],
       "networking": {
         "protocol": "http",
         "auth": true,
         "port": 8080
       }
     }'
```

The GPU class IDs above are examples for RTX 3090, RTX 3090 Ti, and RTX 4090. Use the
[List GPU Classes](/reference/saladcloud-api/organizations/list-gpu-classes) endpoint to get current GPU IDs.

In the data field, you can configure various parameters to define your container group's behavior and characteristics.
For detailed information on these parameters and their options, please refer to the
[Create a Container Group](/reference/saladcloud-api/container-groups/create-container-group) endpoint.

## Step 3: Select Multiple GPUs

To enable the use of multiple GPUs within a container, you'll need to:

1. Retrieve GPU IDs : Begin by obtaining the list of available GPUs. To do this, execute the following curl command
   ```shell
   curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/organization-name/gpu-classes \
        --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {api-key}' \
        --header 'accept: application/json'
   ```
2. Note GPU IDs : Once you receive the response, identify and make note of the unique IDs corresponding to the GPUs you
   intend to use.
3. Configure Your Workload : When setting up your workload, include the GPU IDs in the gpu_classes field. For example,
   if you plan to utilize GPUs like 3090s, 3090Tis, and 4090s, structure your configuration like this

   ```json
   {
     "container": {
       "resources": {
         "cpu": 1,
         "memory": 1024,
         "gpu_classes": [
           "ed563892-ae4f-example-90c9be6c759b",
           "a5db5c50-asd9-example-6a0c8090d80f",
           "9998fe42-04a5-example-849943f16c38"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

_Note: you can also test it on our [API reference page](/reference/saladcloud-api/organizations/list-gpu-classes)_

## **Step 4: Check the Deployment Status**

After you send the POST request in previous step, SaladCloud will begin the process of deploying your container image.
To check the status of the deployment, you can send a GET request to the following URL.

```
https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers/{container_group_name}
```

Replace `{organization_name}`,` {project_name}`, and `{container_group_name}` with the name of your organization,
project, and the container group you want to check, respectively.

Include the following headers in your GET request:

- `Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}`
- `accept: application/json`

Here's an example of how to send the GET request using curl:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers/{container_group_name} \
     --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

The response will include the current status of the deployment, as well as other details about the container.

_**Note**: By default, when you deploy a container group via the public API, auto-start is set to false. You can start
it by either visiting the[ portal](https://portal.salad.com/) or using the
[public API ](/reference/saladcloud-api/container-groups/start-container-group) itself_
