To fine-tune how autoscaling works in SaladCloud, you can adjust the following settings:

### **Desired Queue Length**

- **Description**: The target queue length that triggers the autoscaler to adjust the number of container instances.
- **Range**: Must be between 1 and 100.
- **Example**: If you set this to 20, the system will aim to maintain a queue length of 20 messages before scaling up or
  down.

### **Minimum Replicas**

- **Description**: The minimum number of container instances that the system will scale down to.
- **Range**: Must be between 0 and 100.
- **Example**: If you set this to 3, the system will never scale below 3 running instances, even during low demand
  periods. If set to 0, the system will scale down to zero instances when there are no jobs in the queue, which means
  you do not pay for any resources when the queue is empty. However, this will result in cold starts when new jobs are
  added to the queue. A cold start happens when the system needs to start new containers, potentially causing delays as
  the instances are brought online.

### **Maximum Replicas**

- **Description**: The maximum number of container instances that the system will scale up to.
- **Range**: Must be between 1 and 200, or the maximum instance quota assigned to the project, whichever is lower.
- **Note**: The maximum allowed value depends on the project instance quota. Ensure that your quota supports the desired
  number of replicas.
- **Example**: If set to 100, the system will never spin up more than 100 instances, even if the queue continues to
  grow.

### **Period (Seconds)**

- **Description**: The time interval in seconds during which the autoscaler checks the queue length and applies the
  scaling formula.
- **Range**: Must be between 15 and 1800 seconds.
- **Example**: If set to 30, the queue is checked every 30 seconds, and scaling decisions are made at that frequency.

### **Maximum Upscale Per Minute (Optional)**

- **Description**: The maximum number of instances that can be added per minute to handle increasing demand.
- **Range**: Must be between 1 and 100.
- **Example**: Setting this to 20 means that the autoscaler can spin up a maximum of 20 new instances each minute to
  accommodate increasing load.

### **Maximum Downscale Per Minute (Optional)**

- **Description**: The maximum number of instances that can be removed per minute when demand decreases.
- **Range**: Must be between 1 and 100.
- **Example**: If set to 10, no more than 10 instances will be removed per minute during downscaling, ensuring a smooth
  reduction in resources.
- **Note**: When scaling down, the system might remove nodes that are still processing jobs. To prevent this, ensure
  that your application can handle graceful shutdowns and that jobs are not lost during the process.
