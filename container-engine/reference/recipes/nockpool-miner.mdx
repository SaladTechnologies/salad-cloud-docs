description: Deploy the NockPool GPU miner on SaladCloud to earn NOCK with your NockPool account token.
---

Run the **NockPool GPU Miner** recipe to connect your SaladCloud workers directly to your NockPool account and start
earning $NOCK.

## About NOCK Token

NOCK is the native token of the NockPool network, a decentralized GPU mining pool focused on zero-knowledge proof
generation and other GPU-intensive computation tasks. By running the NockPool miner on SaladCloud, you contribute GPU
compute power to the network and earn NOCK tokens based on the computational work your nodes submit.

## Prerequisites

- NockPool account at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) with your wallet connected and payout address set.
- An account token from the [NockPool Setup](https://nockpool.com/setup) page (starts with `nockacct_`). Keep this
  secret—it is passed to the container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.
- A SaladCloud project with access to deploy recipes.

## Deploy the recipe

1. Open the **NockPool GPU Miner** recipe in the SaladCloud catalog.
2. Enter a container group name and paste your NockPool account token into the form.
3. Deploy the group; each container will authenticate to NockPool using your token and begin submitting shares.

## Payouts and fees

- You must complete KYC in NockPool before requesting a payout.
- NockPool processes payout requests once per day based on submissions before **12AM GMT**.
- The minimum withdrawal is **50.00 NOCK**, and **20.00 NOCK** must remain available to cover network fees.
- NockPool charges a fee on each payout when earnings are withdrawn.
