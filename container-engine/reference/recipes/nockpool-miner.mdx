description: Deploy the NockPool GPU Prover on SaladCloud to earn NOCK with your NockPool account token.
---

Run the **NockPool GPU Prover** recipe to connect your SaladCloud workers directly to your NockPool account and start
earning $NOCK.

## About NOCK Token

NOCK is the native token of the Nockchain network. Nockchain is a novel Layer-1 blockchain focused on "programmable
sound money," uniquely using Zero-Knowledge Proof of Work (zkPoW) for consensus, not just traditional hashing, allowing
for verifiable, efficient, and scalable computation within its network. By running the NockPool prover on SaladCloud,
you contribute compute power to the network and earn NOCK tokens based on the computational work your nodes submit.

## Prerequisites

- NockPool account at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com/) with your wallet connected and payout address set.
- An account token from the [NockPool Setup](https://nockpool.com/setup) page (starts with `nockacct_`). Keep this
  secret. It is passed to the container as `ACCOUNT_TOKEN`.
- A SaladCloud project with access to deploy recipes.

## Deploy the recipe

1. Open the **NockPool GPU Prover** recipe in the SaladCloud catalog.
2. Enter a container group name and paste your NockPool account token into the form.
3. Deploy the group; each container will authenticate to NockPool using your token and begin submitting shares.

## Payouts and fees

- You must complete KYC in NockPool before requesting a payout.
- NockPool processes payout requests once per day based on submissions before **12AM GMT**.
- The minimum withdrawal is **50.00 NOCK**, and **20.00 NOCK** must remain available to cover network fees.
- Nockpool charges a 4% pool fee on all blocks won by the pool. Network transaction fees are included only on
  withdrawals.
