## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy and run **Kuzco (inference.net)**, a decentralized GPU network built on the **Solana
blockchain**, using **SaladCloud**. Kuzco manages powerful AI inference workloads, particularly for large language
models (LLMs) such as **Llama3** and **Mistral**. SaladCloud simplifies deployment, allowing to easily provide compute
resources to Kuzco and earn tokens (_$INT points_).

## How to Use This Recipe

### Step 1: Register an Account at Inference.net (Kuzco)

1. Visit [https://devnet.inference.net/register](https://devnet.inference.net/register).
2. Complete the registration form.
3. Verify your email by clicking the confirmation link.

### Step 2: Create Your Worker

1. Log into your [Kuzco dashboard](https://devnet.inference.net/dashboard/home).
2. Navigate to the **Workers** tab.
3. Skip to **Step 3** if you already have a worker created.
4. Click **Create Worker** at the top-right.
5. Enter a descriptive worker name.
6. Select **Docker** as the deployment type.
7. Click **Create Worker**.

### Step 3: Launch Your Worker

1. You will be redirected to the **Worker Details** page.
2. Click **Launch Worker** to generate and pull your unique worker code.

### Step 4: Deploy Kuzco on SaladCloud

1. Log into the Salad portal: [https://portal.salad.com/](https://portal.salad.com/)
2. Open an existing organization or create a new one.
3. Click **"Deploy a Container Group"**.
4. Scroll down to the **Recipes** section, find **Kuzco (inference.net)** and click **"Get Started"**.
5. Enter a unique **Container Group Name**.
6. Paste the **Kuzco code** you generated in the previous step.
7. (Optional) Set the **number of replicas** depending on how many instances of a worker you want to run.
8. (Optional) Click **"Modify Configuration"** to adjust advanced settings like GPU.
9. Click **Deploy**.

SaladCloud will find a qualified GPU node and begin downloading the container image. This may take several minutes
depending on the network and system conditions of the selected node.

Once deployed, the container group will enter the **Running** state and show a green checkmark in the **"Ready"**
column. Your Kuzco worker is now active.

You can confirm the worker is live and earning by visiting the **Worker Details** page in your Kuzco dashboard:
