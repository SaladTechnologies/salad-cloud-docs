# Prepaid Billing

SaladCloud used prepaid billing. In order to keep your organization's workloads active, you must maintain a positive
credit balance. There are two options to do this on SaladCloud: Auto Recharge and Manual Recharge.

## Auto Recharge

SaladCloud recommends enabling auto recharge for organizations serving production workloads to ensure uninterrupted
service. With auto recharge, you configure a threshold and recharge amount, allowing SaladCloud to automatically
replenish your organization’s credit balance when needed.

    •	Recharge Threshold: The balance level that triggers an auto recharge ("when my balance falls below").

    •	Recharge Amount: The predefined amount SaladCloud charges to your payment method when the threshold is reached ("bring credit balance back up to").

You can update these settings anytime through the Billing & Usage page in your organization’s portal. If you set the
recharge threshold to an amount higher than your current credit balance, an auto recharge will be triggered immediately
upon saving the updated settings.

If an auto recharge encounters an error with the payment method, SaladCloud sends an email notification, and the
organization’s workloads are given a grace period to resolve the issue. If the issue is not resolved promptly,
SaladCloud reserves the right to stop all active workloads and API usage.

## Manual Recharge

Manual credit recharges provide an alternative way to maintain a positive credit balance for your organization. At any
time, you can add up to $10,000 in credits to your account by clicking the “Add to Credit Balance” button on the Billing
& Usage page.

For amounts exceeding $10,000, please refer to our volume discount instructions below.

If your organization is not enrolled in auto recharge and the account balance reaches $0.00, all active workloads and
API usage will stop immediately until a positive credit balance is restored. For organizations running production
workloads, SaladCloud strongly recommends enabling auto recharge to prevent service interruptions.

# How Are Charges Calculated?

SaladCloud only charges for the hardware resources that are dedicated to your application while your container is
Running on one of our machines. Our flexible billing model allows you to customize each machine to your exact hardware
requirements, no more selecting an instance type from an endlessly long pricing sheet.

## Hardware Resources

When creating a Container Group in SCE, you select the required hardware that will be dedicated to your application when
it runs on SaladCloud. The current rate for each type of hardware can be found on our
[pricing page](https://salad.com/pricing). For GPU container groups, there are no additional charges for RAM and vCPU.

### Example 1

You create a Container Group with 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, no GPU, and 10 replicas

Per Instance Cost = 1 vCPU x $0.004 per vCPU + 2 GB x $0.001 per GB = $0.006/hr

**Total Cost** = $0.006/hr (per Instance) x 10 replicas = $0.06/hr

### Example 2

You create a Container Group with 4 vCPU, 6 GB RAM, RTX 3060 GPU at "Low" priority, and 5 replicas

Per Instance Cost = 1 RTX 3060 at "Low" Priority x $0.047 = $0.047/hr

**Total Cost** = $0.047/hr (per Instance) x 5 replicas = $0.235 /hr

## Running Time

SaladCloud bills for the time that the selected hardware resources are dedicated to your application, although it is
common to see hourly rates listed on Salad, usage is tracked per second.

> 🎉 Never Pay for Cold Boot Time Again
>
> You only pay for the time that the hardware is available to used by your application, you will never pay for Cold Boot
> time.

# Preauthorization Requests

We may send a preauthorization request to the issuing bank to verify a bank will authorize charges. Some credit card
companies present these as real charges, which may surprise you.

A preauth is really just a hold on a credit card. We'll typically preauthorize a small amount (usually $10) when a new
payment method is added to your Organization, then cancel the authorization immediately. Banks may show the preauth for
up to 7 days, even though we have not collected any money.

# Accepted Payment Types

SaladCloud only accepts valid credit cards as a payment method through the SaladCloud portal. Debit and prepaid cards
are not accepted. For additional payment methods, please reach out to [sales@salad.com](mailto:sales@salad.com).
