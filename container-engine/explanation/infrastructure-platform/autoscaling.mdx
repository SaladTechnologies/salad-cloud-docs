_Last Updated: October 25, 2024_

The new **Autoscaling** feature in SaladCloud dynamically adjusts the number of container instances based on the number
of messages in a queue. This ensures that your infrastructure scales up when demand increases and scales down during low
usage periods, optimizing both performance and cost efficiency.

To use the autoscaling feature, you need to integrate the Job Queue into your container groups. The system will monitor
the queue length and adjust the number of container replicas accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable autoscaling, you must configure the Job Queue:

1. Ensure that the [**Job Queue**](/container-engine/explanation/job-processing/job-queues) is enabled for your
   container group.
2. Verify that your application can handle scaling with multiple container instances.
3. Review the [Autoscaling Settings](/container-engine/reference/autoscaling/settings) to understand how to fine-tune
   autoscaling for your workloads.

## Example Use Case

Let's say you run a batch job, but the number of jobs you receive is inconsistent. Sometimes, there are no jobs at all,
and you want to scale down to zero instances to avoid paying for unused compute resources. By setting the **Minimum
Replicas** to 0, the system will automatically scale down to zero when the queue is empty, which means you don't pay for
any resources when there is no workload. However, this will result in cold starts when new jobs arrive. Cold starts
occur when the system needs to initialize new instances, which can introduce a delay while containers are started from
an inactive state.

At other times, you might experience a spike where thousands of jobs need to be processed quickly. By setting the
**Maximum Replicas** to 100, you can scale up and process all the jobs much faster. Even though you're using more
instances, you're still paying for the same amount of compute hours you would have spent on one instance, but the jobs
are completed 100 times faster, reducing overall processing time.
