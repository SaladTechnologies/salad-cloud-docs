_Last Updated: June 3, 2025_

## Overview

Setting the instance deletion cost is a powerful and flexible way to manage scale-in behavior for container groups.
Note, however, that this deletion cost only applies when intentional scaling events occur, such as setting replica
count, or via autoscaling policies. It does not apply to instances that are terminated due to other reasons, such as
host interruptions or failed instances.

When a salad container group is scaled in via adjusting its replica count or an autoscaling policy, the instance
deletion cost determines how the system selects which instances to terminate. The instance deletion cost is an integer
value with a default of `0` that you can assign to each instance in the container group. Instances with a lower deletion
cost are prioritized for termination when scaling down.

Assigning this value can be done from within the application through the instance metadata service, using the
[Replace Deletion Cost Endpoint](/reference/imds/replace-deletion-cost). It can also be done externally via the
[Update Container Group Instance Endpoint](/reference/saladcloud-api/container-groups/update-container-group-instance).
This function is also available in SaladCloudIMDS SDKs, and the SaladCloud SDKs respectively. **In general, you should
only use one of these methods to set the deletion cost for an instance, as using both may lead to unexpected behavior.**

_Accessed from within the container group instance._

```shell
curl --request PUT \
  --url http://169.254.169.254/v1/deletion-cost \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Metadata: true' \
  --data '{
  "deletion_cost": 100
}'
```

**[SaladCloud API Endpoint:](/reference/saladcloud-api/container-groups/update-container-group-instance)**

_Accessed externally via the SaladCloud API._

```shell
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers/{container_group_name}/instances/{container_group_instance_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json' \
  --header 'Salad-Api-Key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "deletion_cost": 100
}'
```

## Example 1: Batch Model Finetuning

Suppose you have a container group running dozens or hundreds of instances, each pulling training jobs from a queue. In
this situation, you would want idle nodes to set their deletion cost to 0, while nodes that are actively doing work
could gradually increase their deletion cost as the job progresses. This way, if replica count is reduced, the system
would not interrupt the training job by terminating an instance that is currently processing a task, but rather
terminate an idle instance instead.

## Example 2: Image Generation with ComfyUI

In a scenario where you are using ComfyUI for large-scale image generation, instances may accumulate work in their
internal queues. You can set the deletion cost of the instance to the depth of the queue, so that fewer jobs are lost
when scaling down. For example, if an instance has a queue depth of 5, you can set its deletion cost to 5. This way, if
the system needs to scale down, it will prioritize terminating instances with a lower deletion cost, thus preserving
instances that are actively processing jobs in their queues.
