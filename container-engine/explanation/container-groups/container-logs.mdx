## How to Log From Your Container

When running a container on SaladCloud, you can log to the standard output and standard error streams. These logs are
collected and stored by SaladCloud, and exported to any configured
[external logging source](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/external-logging).

## Basic Logging

### How to View Container Logs In the Portal

Once your container is up and running on a SaladCloud node, you can view the logs from your container on the "Container
Logs" tab of a Container Group. To access this feature in the portal, navigate to your Container Group details page, and
click on the 'Container Logs' tab.

You can also navigate to this page from the Action menu of an instance. This option will take you to the Container Logs
tab with the Machine ID value pre-filled.

The Container Logs feature has a simple interface is meant to provide you with enough visibility for basic
troubleshooting of your applications running on SaladCloud, but it is not an exhaustive logging solution and lacks
analytics and filtering features that are available on dedicated logging platforms. For more robust logging
functionality, we recommend configuring the
[External Logging Service option](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/external-logging) in your
container group.

The Container Logs feature allows you to query your container logs with these options:

- search for specific log messages with case-insensitive string filtering
- filter for logs from a specific Machine ID. If left blank, logs from all Machine IDs in the Container Group will be
  returned.
- filter for logs in a specified time period. Choose one of the predefined options, or use the custom start date and end
  date option

When your query returns results you will see them in a scrollable table view. Each result includes:

- Log Message
- Machine ID (The unique ID of the node running the container that created the log message.)
- Log Create Time

Should your query yield no results, the table view will display "No data to display"

**Availability and Limitations**

This feature is available exclusively through the SaladCloud portal interface, not accessible via the public API. It's
in an early "Preview" stage, with the following considerations:

- A maximum of 500 logs can be returned per query. Utilize specific query filters and time ranges to get the logs you
  are looking for.
- Logs are retained and accessible for up to 90 days.
- If you encounter this error message, try narrowing your query's time range
