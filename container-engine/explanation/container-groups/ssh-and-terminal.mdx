_Last Updated: December 15, 2025_

You can start an interactive shell inside your running container instances using SSH or the web-based terminal in the
SaladCloud Portal. This requires your container image to have a shell installed, such as `bash` or `sh`.

Open the SaladCloud Portal and navigate to one of your container groups. Click on an instance. Click on the "Terminal"
tab.
