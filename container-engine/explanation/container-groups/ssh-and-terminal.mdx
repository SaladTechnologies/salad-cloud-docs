You can start an interactive shell inside your running container instances using SSH or the web-based terminal in the
SaladCloud Portal. This requires your container image to have a shell installed, such as `bash` or `sh`.

## SSH Access

Use SSH to open a shell on a running container instance after adding your public key in the SaladCloud Portal.

1. Create an SSH key (skip this if you already have one):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
   ```

   By default, this creates `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private key) and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public key).

2. Copy your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. Add the key in the Portal:

   - Click your username in the upper-right corner.
   - Select "SSH key".
   - Paste the public key into the field and save it.

4. Connect to a container instance. Open your container group, select an instance, and copy its SSH IP and port (or the
   SSH command shown). Run:

   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p <ssh_port> <ssh_user>@<ssh_ip>
   ```

   If you used a different key name or type, replace `id_ed25519` with your key file name.

## Terminal Access

Open the SaladCloud Portal and navigate to one of your container groups. Click on an instance. Click on the "Terminal"
tab.
