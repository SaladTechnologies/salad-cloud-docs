SaladCloud is a **managed container service**, which means that we use containers to run your workloads. Containers and
Virtual Private Servers or Virtual Machines (VPS or VM) are both popular methods for deploying applications, but they
have some key differences.

### Containers

Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that allows multiple applications to run on the same operating
system kernel. They share the host OS and isolate applications at the process level. This makes containers very
efficient in terms of resource usage, as they do not require a full OS for each application. Containers are typically
faster to start and stop compared to VMs, making them ideal for scalable and dynamic environments.

In general, containers are more portable and easier to manage than VPS, as they can be easily moved between different
environments and orchestrated using popular open source tools. They are most often not intended to be interacted with
via a terminal, but rather to run a specific application or service.

Unlike a VPS which may have dependencies installed on it at runtime, containers are typically built with all necessary
dependencies included at the time of creation. This makes containers more consistent and predictable in terms of
behavior across different environments.

### Virtual Private Servers (VPS)

VPS, on the other hand, are a type of virtual machine that runs its own operating system on top of a hypervisor. Each
VPS is allocated a fixed amount of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) and operates independently of other VPS instances on
the same host. This provides a higher level of isolation and security, as each VPS has its own OS and file system.
However, this also means that VPS can be more resource-intensive and slower to start compared to containers.

VPS are often used during development or for applications that require a full OS environment. They are typically managed
via SSH or a web-based control panel. VPS can be more complex to manage, as they require regular updates and maintenance
of the underlying OS.

### Summary

In summary, containers are a lightweight and efficient way to run applications, while VPS provide a higher level of
isolation and security. The choice between the two will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the
environment in which it will be deployed. For most modern applications, especially those that need to operate at scale,
containers are often the preferred choice due to their efficiency and portability.
