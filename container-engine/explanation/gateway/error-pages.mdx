When the Container Gateway is configured for a container group, it will be assigned an Access Domain Name URL. If you
try to access that URL in your browser, and encounter an error, we provide error messaging to help you understand the
nature of the error. Errors can occur, for example, when a container has not been fully set up yet, or has failed.

If a 503 occurs, check that it is passing on at least 1 instance.
