title: 'Startup Probes'

# Overview

Startup probes, when configured, run as soon as the container is created. They are typically used to ensure that the
application has started, and is ready to accept traffic. No traffic will be sent from the load balancer until the
startup probe has passed, so prevent your startup probe from passing until you have downloaded and warmed up your
models.

# Configuration

Check the checkbox to enable the startup probe. Currently, the supported protocols are `exec`, `gRPC`, `TCP`, and
`HTTP/1.X`
