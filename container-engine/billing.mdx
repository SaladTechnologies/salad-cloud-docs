We require an active, valid credit card on file for most accounts. This is primarily a means to prevent abuse and ensure that we can collect payment at the end of the month.

# How Are Charges Calculated?

Salad only charges for the hardware resources that are dedicated to your application while your container is Running on one of our machines. Our flexible billing model allows you to customize each machine to your exact hardware requirements, no more selecting an instance type from an endlessly long pricing sheet.

## Hardware Resources

When creating a Container Group in SCE, you select the required hardware that will be dedicated to your application when it runs on Salad. The current rate for each type of hardware can be found on our [pricing page](https://salad.com/pricing).

### Example 1

You create a Container Group with 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, no GPU, and 10 replicas

Per Instance Cost = 1 vCPU x $0.004 per vCPU + 2 GB x $0.001 per GB = $0.006/hr

**Total Cost** = $0.006/hr (per Instance) x 10 replicas = $0.06/hr

### Example 2

You create a Container Group with 4 vCPU, 6 GB RAM, RTX 3060 GPU, and 5 replicas

Per Instance Cost = 4 vCPU x $0.004 per vCPU + 6 GB x $0.001 per GB + 1 RTX 3060 x $0.08 = $0.132/hr

**Total Cost** = $0.132/hr (per Instance) x 5 replicas = $0.66/hr

## Running Time

Salad bills for the time that the selected hardware resources are dedicated to your application, although it is common to see hourly rates listed on Salad, usage is tracked per second.

# Preauthorization Requests

We may send a preauthorization request to the issuing bank to verify a bank will authorize charges. Some credit card companies present these as real charges, which may surprise you.

A preauth is really just a hold on a credit card. We'll typically preauthorize a small amount (usually $10) when a new payment method is added to your Organization, then cancel the authorization immediately. Banks may show the preauth for up to 7 days, even though we have not collected any money.

# Incremental Billing

Salad will charge the payment method on file each time your bill reaches $200. This helps mitigate fraud on the platform. If you use a high volume of compute and have an account in good standing, this requirement may be waived. Reach out to your account manager to learn more.

If a payment fails, you will be notified by email. If a valid payment method has not been added to your account, your deployments will be terminated. Any remaining balance will be billed at the end of the month.
