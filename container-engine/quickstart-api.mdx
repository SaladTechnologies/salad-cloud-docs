title: 'Quickstart - API'
---

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An account with Salad Cloud. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for a free trial at
  [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
- A project in Salad Cloud. If you don't have a project yet, you can create one by following the instructions in the
  Salad Cloud documentation.
- A container image that you want to deploy. If you don't have a container image yet, you can build one using a tool
  like [Docker.](https://www.docker.com/)

## **Step 1: Obtain Your API Key**

To authenticate your API requests, you'll need an API key. To obtain your API key, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Salad Cloud account at [https://portal.salad.com](https://portal.salad.com)
- Click on your profile in the top right corner of the page, then click API Keys.
- Copy the API key that is displayed. You'll need this in the next step.

## **Step 2: Deploy the Container Image**

To deploy a container group using the Salad Cloud Public API, you'll need to send a POST request with specific
parameters inside the data field along with headers. Here's how to do it:

Send a POST request to the following URL:

```
https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers
```

Replace `{organization_name}` and `{project_name}` with the name of your organization and project, respectively.

Include the following headers in your request:

- `Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}`
- `accept: application/json`
- `content-type: application/json`

Include a JSON payload in the data field of the request body with the necessary configuration parameters. Here's an
example using curl:

```json curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers \
     --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "container": {
         "resources": {
           "memory": 2048,
           "cpu": 1,
           "gpu_classes": [
             "ed563892-aacd-40f5-80b7-90c9be6c759b", // ID for 3090s
             "a5db5c50-cbcb-4596-ae80-6a0c8090d80f", // ID for 3090Tis
             "9998fe42-04a5-4807-b3a5-849943f16c38" // ID for 4090s
           ],
           "image": "{CONTAINER_IMAGE_URL}" // Container image URL
         },
         "restart_policy": "always",
         "country_codes": ["af"],
         "networking": {
           "protocol": "http",
           "auth": true,
           "port": 8080
         },
         "name": "demo-test",
         "replicas": 1  // Number of replicas
       }
     }'

```

In the data field, you can configure various parameters to define your container group's behavior and characteristics.
For detailed information on these parameters and their options, please refer to the
[Create a Container Group](https://docs.salad.com/reference/create_container_group)

## **Step 3: Select Multiple GPUs**

To enable the use of multiple GPUs within a container, you'll need to:

1. Retrieve GPU IDs : Begin by obtaining the list of available GPUs. To do this, execute the following curl command
   ```json curl
   curl --request GET \
        --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/organization-name/gpu-classes \
        --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {api-key}' \
        --header 'accept: application/json'
   ```
2. Note GPU IDs : Once you receive the response, identify and make note of the unique IDs corresponding to the GPUs you
   intend to use.
3. Configure Your Workload : When setting up your workload, include the GPU IDs in the gpu_classes field. For example,
   if you plan to utilize GPUs like 3090s, 3090Tis, and 4090s, structure your configuration like this

   ```json json
   "container": {
     "resources": {
       "cpu": 1,
       "memory": 1024,
       "gpu_classes": [
         "ed563892-aacd-example-90c9be6c759b",  // ID for 3090s
         "a5db5c50-cbcb-example-6a0c8090d80f",  // ID for 3090Tis
         "9998fe42-04a5-example-849943f16c38"  // ID for 4090s
       ]
     }
   }

   ```

_Note: you can also test it on our [API reference page](https://docs.salad.com/reference/list_gpu_classes)_

## **Step 4: Check the Deployment Status**

After you send the POST request in previous step, Salad Cloud will begin the process of deploying your container image.
To check the status of the deployment, you can send a GET request to the following URL.

```json curl
https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers/{container_group_name}
```

Replace `{organization_name}`,` {project_name}`, and `{container_group_name}` with the name of your organization,
project, and the container group you want to check, respectively.

Include the following headers in your GET request:

- `Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}`
- `accept: application/json`

Here's an example of how to send the GET request using curl:

```json curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/containers/{container_group_name} \
     --header 'Salad-Api-Key: {API_KEY}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

The response will include the current status of the deployment, as well as other details about the container.

_**Note**: By default, when you deploy a container group via the public API, auto-start is set to false. You can start
it by either visiting the[ portal](https://portal.salad.com/) or using the
[public API ](https://docs.salad.com/reference/start_container_group)itself_
