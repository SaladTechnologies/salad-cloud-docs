title: "Adding Jobs to the Queue"
---

# Posting a Job

Jobs are created and added to the queue by sending a `POST` request to the Job Queue API at `https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/{organization_name}/projects/{project_name}/queues/{queue_name}/jobs`

> ðŸ“˜ Using the Salad API
>
> Salad offers a full API to access all of the functionality of the Portal, as well as additional features (such as adding Jobs to the Job Queue!). You can learn more about authentication and how to use the Salad API [here](https://docs.salad.com/reference/api-reference).

# Job Structure

### Input

The request should include an `"input": { ... }` which must be valid JSON. This is the information passed to your application running in the container.

### Metadata (optional)

The response will include a unique call id generated by Salad that can be used to retrieve your results. If you wish to attach your own id to the job for tracking purposes, you may include it in an optional, arbitrary `"metadata": { ... }` object. Note that `metadata` must be a valid JSON _object_, as opposed to the `input` which may be any JSON format (string, object, number, etc.).

> ðŸ“˜ JSON output
>
> The Queue Worker expects valid JSON input (that it will pass to your application), as well as valid JSON output (completed results that it sends up to the Job Queue). Please ensure that your application returns JSON-formatted results.

# Example Job

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "id": "my-custom-id-123"
  },
  "input": {
    "width": 640,
    "height": 480,
    "iterations": 10,
    "re_min": -2,
    "re_max": 1,
    "im_min": -1,
    "im_max": 1,
    "kind": "base64"
  }
}
```

# Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "50150edd-e182-47b5-a754-2d2a04d6ee31",
  "input": {
    "width": 640,
    "height": 480,
    "iterations": 10,
    "re_min": -2,
    "re_max": 1,
    "im_min": -1,
    "im_max": 1,
    "kind": "base64"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "id": "my-custom-id-123"
  },
  "status": "pending",
  "events": [
    {
      "action": "created",
      "time": "2024-01-20T01:02:48.4787553+00:00"
    }
  ],
  "create_time": "2024-01-20T01:02:48.4787553+00:00",
  "update_time": "2024-01-20T01:02:48.4787553+00:00"
}
```

Note the Salad-generated `"id"` field. We will use this in the next step when we check the status of the job and retrieve results.
