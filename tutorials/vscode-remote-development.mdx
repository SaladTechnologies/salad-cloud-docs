title: 'VS Code Remote Development on SaladCloud'
description: 'Run, test and debug your AI applications on live Salad GPU nodes'
---

## Introduction

AI developers using macOS or Windows can seamlessly connect to over 30 types of Salad GPU nodes via VS Code, enabling
real-time testing and debugging in live environments — before moving to production. This gives them full access to GPU
resources, [environment variables](/products/sce/container-groups/environment-variables),
[IMDS endpoints](/products/sce/container-groups/imds/introduction), and more. Developers can validate VRAM usage,
network behavior, and external resource access; fine-tune application parameters such as local queue lengths, batch
sizes, and thread counts; and catch rare, real-world edge cases that static testing often misses.

There are several ways to enable VS Code remote development on SaladCloud.

Tailscale can provide secure, direct network access between your developer laptop and Salad nodes, supporting both TCP
and UDP-based applications. Using the [Remote - SSH extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) in VS Code
Desktop, you can connect to a Salad node over its Tailscale IP, which launches a VS Code Server on the node. This allows
you to easily open remote folders or clone GitHub repositories to begin development and testing directly on the node.
**This solution is simple to deploy, scales greatly, and is highly recommended.** For more details on integrating
Tailscale with workloads on SaladCloud, please refer to [this guide](/guides/tailscale-integration/solution-overview).

You can also leverage [VS Code Remote - Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), powered by
[Microsoft Dev Tunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview), which supports two
integration modes with SaladCloud — **automatic** and **interactive** — each tailored to different use cases. Both modes
are covered in this guide.

**Notes:** Since Salad nodes are interruptible and may shut down unexpectedly, it's crucial to commit your changes
regularly to your repositories via VS Code or back them up to the cloud using the appropriate SDKs or APIs.

## Microsoft Dev Tunnels

[Dev Tunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) enable secure, authenticated
connections over the Internet, allowing developers to expose local services — such as applications running on Salad
nodes — to remote clients, including browsers and custom applications. Both clients and servers can remain behind
firewalls and NATs; they only need to initiate outbound connections to Azure, which handles secure relaying, identity
and management services.

Each server requires a dedicated tunnel, which can be accessed by multiple clients. While tunnels are primarily for TCP
connections, UDP-based protocols are also supported by Dev Tunnels.

Currently in public preview and free to use, Dev Tunnels require either a GitHub or Microsoft account for access. Each
account supports up to 10 tunnels, with each tunnel offering speeds of up to 20 MB/s and a total monthly data transfer
limit of 5.0 GB per account. Please check
[the link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#dev-tunnels-limits)
for more details.

Below is an illustration of how applications leverage Dev Tunnels on SaladCloud:

## VS Code Remote - Tunnels

[VS Code Remote - Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) is built on Microsoft Dev Tunnels to
simplify remote development. It allows developers to connect to remote VS Code Servers (such as those running on
SaladCloud) using the Remote - Tunnels extension in VS Code Desktop or a browser, without requiring direct network
access between the local and remote environments.

To enable access, the remote environment must launch the VS Code Server in tunnel mode — either by creating a new tunnel
or using an existing one to expose it. This can be done by running
[the VS Code Server CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels#_using-the-code-cli) (ideal for headless
environments like Salad nodes) or by enabling
[the Remote Tunnel Access](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels#_using-the-vs-code-ui) from an existing VS
Code Desktop installation. Once the tunnel is active, developers can connect to the remote VS Code Server through it.

Similar to Dev Tunnels, this solution requires a GitHub or Microsoft account, and all Dev Tunnels specifications and
limitations still apply. For instance, each Salad node must have its own dedicated tunnel, but multiple clients — using
either VS Code Desktop or a browser — can connect to the same node through that tunnel.

There are two ways to use this solution on SaladCloud:

- **Automatic Mode** – This mode supports only single-replica container group deployments on SaladCloud, and the
  container image must be modified to launch the VS Code Server using an existing tunnel. You can manually create a
  tunnel and generate an access token using the Dev Tunnels CLI, which requires interactive browser-based authentication
  and must be done outside of SaladCloud. Both the tunnel ID and access token can then be passed as environment
  variables to a single-replica container group on SaladCloud. Once the container starts — or after a node reallocation
  — the VS Code Server automatically starts and connects using the provided tunnel and token, without requiring any
  manual intervention at runtime.

- **Interactive Mode** – Non-intrusive, requiring no changes to the container image. You can access any running Salad
  node through the terminal in the SaladCloud Portal, then manually install and launch the VS Code Server in tunnel
  mode. This process requires interactive browser-based authentication, which can be completed on your developer laptop.

## Automatic Mode

### Prepare Your Container Image

Here is [an example application](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/vscode-remote-tunnels/tree/main/automatic) that
demonstrates how to enable the automatic mode for container images running on SaladCloud.

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/vscode-remote-tunnels/blob/main/automatic/Dockerfile) creates a
containerized environment by using a base image, then installing essential utilities and required dependencies including
the VS Code Server CLI. It also copies the required Python code and startup script into the image.

```Dockerfile Dockerfile
# Base image selection
FROM docker.io/python:3.12.3
#FROM docker.io/pytorch/pytorch:2.6.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime

# Install essential utilities
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl net-tools iputils-ping

# Upgrade pip and install Python packages
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install flask python-dotenv

# Install VS Code Server CLI
RUN curl -Lk 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=cli-alpine-x64' --output vscode_cli.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf vscode_cli.tar.gz
RUN mv ./code /usr/local/bin/code
RUN rm vscode_cli.tar.gz

# Set working directory and copy application files
WORKDIR /app
COPY hello.py /app
COPY start.sh /app
RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh

# Default startup command
CMD ["./start.sh"]
# the pre-built image: docker.io/saladtechnologies/vscode-remote-tunnels:0.0.1-vscode-remote-tunnels:0.0.1-automatic

```

When the image runs on a Salad node, the
[startup.sh](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/vscode-remote-tunnels/blob/main/automatic/start.sh) script launches
the VS Code Server using an existing tunnel in the background, and then proceeds to execute the original container
command.

```bash start.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Launch the VS Code Server using an existing tunnel
echo -e "\nCreate a tunnel..."
#code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms --name $SALAD_MACHINE_ID --tunnel-id $TUNNEL_ID --host-token $ACCESS_TOKEN &
code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms --name $SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID --tunnel-id $TUNNEL_ID --host-token $ACCESS_TOKEN &

# The containers running on SaladCloud must have a continuously running process; and if the process completes, SaladCloud will automatically reallocate the instances to rerun the image.
echo -e "\nSleeping indefinitely..."
sleep infinity
```

The --name parameter assigns a user-friendly name for the tunnel (uniquely associated with the Salad node), which is
used when connecting from a browser:

```
https://vscode.dev/tunnel/name_of_tunnel
```

SALAD_MACHINE_ID is a unique identifier for each Salad node and is easily viewable in the SaladCloud Portal.
SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID is available through the SaladCloud APIs or SDKs, and can also be retrieved by running env
inside the terminal of a container instance or checking the container logs in the SaladCloud Portal. Currently, all
instances (or replicas) within a container group share the same hostname, which is set to the value of
SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID.

You can use either SALAD_MACHINE_ID or SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID as the value for the --name parameter.

- With SALAD_MACHINE_ID, you can easily connect to a specific node from clients, as the ID is readily accessible from
  the SaladCloud Portal.
- Using SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID (as demonstrated in this example) helps avoid client-side reconfiguration -- such as
  refreshing clients to reconnect automatically -- after node reallocation or container group restarts, since the value
  remains consistent across instances launched at different time within the same container group.

**Note:** Each node requires its own dedicated tunnel, so this image must be run using a single-replica container group
with a unique tunnel. If multiple instances share the same tunnel, they will conflict with each other — resulting in
unstable behavior or failure to connect.

### Create a Tunnel and Generate Access Tokens

Let's create a tunnel with an access token using the Dev Tunnels CLI:

```bash Dev Tunnels CLI
# Create a tunnel
ubuntu@wsl-nuc:~$ devtunnel create
Tunnel ID             : joyful-field-ct6cnqj.usw3
Description           :
Labels                :
Access control        : {}
Host connections      : 0
Client connections    : 0
Current upload rate   : 0 MB/s (limit: 20 MB/s)
Current download rate : 0 MB/s (limit: 20 MB/s)
Tunnel Expiration     : 30 days

ubuntu@wsl-nuc:~$ devtunnel list
Found 1 tunnel.
Tunnel ID                           Host Connections     Labels                    Ports                Expiration                Description

# Generate an access token for the tunnel
ubuntu@wsl-nuc:~$ devtunnel token joyful-field-ct6cnqj.usw3 --scope manage --scope host
Token tunnel ID: joyful-field-ct6cnqj.usw3
Token scopes: manage host
Token lifetime: 1.00:00:01
Token expiration: 2025-04-18 22:02:07 UTC
Token: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IkM3NDYxNEM5OTE0NjUwNzI2REI1RUZBM0M1OTBDQzdGNjJFOUI4QzQiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJjbHVzdGVySWQiOiJ1c3czIiwidHVubmVsSWQiOiJqb3lmdWwtZmllbGQtY3Q2Y25xaiIsInNjcCI6Im1hbmFnZSBob3N0IiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1MDEzNzI3LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3R1bm5lbHMuYXBpLnZpc3VhbHN0dWRpby5jb20vIiwibmJmIjoxNzQ0OTI2NDI3fQ.z-tv08Co7DBZvBjBtSXRExx5hef73vSApsgp3DQBrdDRTGvm4-yYBqanL-XCCEwcOjfE3v5acTfhCnexnPHXrg
```

The default tunnel expiration time is **30 days**, while the token expiration time is limited to **24 hours**. Once a
token expires, it can no longer be used to authenticate a new VS Code Server session. However, any existing session
established before the expiration will typically remain valid.

### Deploy the Container Group

Now your can create a container group with the following parameters using the SaladCloud Portal. For deployment using
SaladCloud APIs/SDKs, please refer to
[this link](/guides/kubernetes-integration/application-deployment#using-saladcloud-apis%2Fsdks).

```
Image Source: docker.io/saladtechnologies/vscode-remote-tunnels:0.0.1-vscode-remote-tunnels:0.0.1-automatic
Resource: 4 vCPUs, 4GB Memory
Replica Count: Must be 1 (single-replica)
Environment Variable: TUNNEL_ID, ACCESS_TOKEN
```

<img src="/tutorials/images/vscode/running.png" />

### Connect to the Salad Node

Once the instance is running, you can retrieve the SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID and connect to it using both VS Code Desktop
and a browser.

```
https://vscode.dev/tunnel/SALAD_CONTAINER_GROUP_ID
```

Start the Python Flask server in the browser:

<img src="/tutorials/images/vscode/auto1.png" />

Use curl to test the application locally in the VS Code Desktop:

<img src="/tutorials/images/vscode/auto2.png" />

### Perform a Check

Let's check the tunnel using the Dev Tunnels CLI:

```bash Dev Tunnels CLI
ubuntu@wsl-nuc:~$ devtunnel list

The automatic mode may fit scenarios where you're developing applications across various Salad GPU nodes over an
extended period. The following summarizes the workflow:

|     | Developer Laptop                                                                                                                                                                                           | SaladCloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Interactive Mode

### Launch the VS Code Server Interactively

To test or debug code in any running instance, open its terminal in the SaladCloud Portal. From there, you can manually
[install the VS Code Server CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels#_using-the-code-cli) — or optionally
include it in your container image during the build process — and start the VS Code Server in tunnel mode interactively.

```bash VS Code Server CLI
# Sign in interactively using a Github account and a device code
# Even though the command is part of the VS Code Server CLI, it specifically authenticates with the Dev Tunnels service

root@564eafc5-c872-414b-b4f6-a6032163a31f:/# code tunnel user login --provider github
To grant access to the server, please log into https://github.com/login/device and use code 8223-8B7E

# Open a browser on your developer laptop, navigate to the provided URL, enter the code, authorize access, and then return to continue.

# Start the VS Code Server in tunnel mode to automatically provision a tunnel, launch the server, and expose it through that tunnel.

# You can now safely close the terminal
# Connect using VS Code Desktop or a browser (https://vscode.dev/tunnel/001)

### Perform a Check

The VS Code Server CLI interacts with the Dev Tunnels service under the hood for authentication and tunnel provisioning.
You can check the tunnels created by the VS Code Server CLI using the Dev Tunnels CLI:

```bash Dev Tunnels CLI
# The --name paramater (001) is saved as a label
ubuntu@wsl-nuc:~$ devtunnel list
Found 1 tunnels.

Tunnel ID                           Host Connections     Labels                    Ports                Expiration                Description
new-hill-7rpsj2g.uks1               1                    001,protocolv4,vscod...   0                    30 days
```

The VS Code Server CLI doesn't always provision a new tunnel. If you relaunch the server on the same Salad node after a
restart, it typically reuses the existing tunnel, even when a new name is provided. When more than 10 tunnels are
created, the older and inactive tunnels would be automatically deleted by Dev Tunnels.

### Workflow Summary

If you only need occasional access to any Salad node for testing or debugging, this mode is ideal. The following
summarizes the workflow:

|     | Developer Laptop                                                           | SaladCloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
