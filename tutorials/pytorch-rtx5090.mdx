title: Running PyTorch on RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs
description: This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to running PyTorch on the Nvidia RTX 50XX series GPUs

_Last Updated: April 2, 2025_

## Overview

Nvidia's new RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs require CUDA 12.8, but PyTorch official releases do not yet support it.
[Check here in case this guide is out of date](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags).

This tutorial provides a workaround to run PyTorch on the RTX 50-series GPUs using the latest nightly build of PyTorch.

<Info>
  If you intend to run a workload both on 50-series gpus and older 40- or 30-series gpus, you will need to maintain
  separate docker images. As of the time of this writing, older GPUs do not have cuda 12.8 support, so the image you
  have to build for the 50-series will not work on older GPUs.

## Dockerfile

This Dockerfile sets up a container with the necessary dependencies to run PyTorch on RTX 50-series GPUs.

We start with the official nvidia/cuda image, using the "runtime" version of CUDA 12.8.1. There is also a "devel"
version available. [See all tags.](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda/tags)

From there, we set up our python environment, and install torch while setting `--index-url` to the nightly build of
PyTorch, built for CUDA 12.8.

```dockerfile
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu24.04
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt update -y && apt install -y \
    wget \
    curl \
    git \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    python3-venv \
    unzip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN python3 -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
RUN . /opt/venv/bin/activate

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio \
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
```

## Build

```bash
docker build -t my-registry/pytorch:nightly-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime --push .
```

## Use

Once you've built the image, you can use it in your dockerfile like any other pytorch base image

```dockerfile
# OLD: pytorch/pytorch:2.6.0-cuda12.6-cudnn8-runtime
FROM my-registry/pytorch:nightly-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime

# Do whatever you want here
```

## Conclusion

That's all there is to it! Now you can run PyTorch on the RTX 50-series GPUs using the latest nightly build.
