## Overview

Nvidia's new RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs require CUDA 12.8. As of April 24, 2025, the latest stable release of PyTorch
(2.7.0) supports this, and you should find success with the
[official pytorch docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch) for CUDA 12.8.

- [pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime](https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorch/pytorch/2.7.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime/images/sha256-7db0e1bf4b1ac274ea09cf6358ab516f8a5c7d3d0e02311bed445f7e236a5d80)
- [pytorch/pytorch:2.7.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-devel](https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorch/pytorch/2.7.0-cuda12.8-cudnn9-devel/images/sha256-e97058f7b9b583517643477cc9a0433e54594038efd85ec4abd7836233d626f3)

This tutorial provides a workaround to run PyTorch on the RTX 50-series GPUs using the latest nightly build of PyTorch.

<Info>
  If you intend to run a workload both on 50-series gpus and older 40- or 30-series gpus, you will need to maintain
  separate docker images. As of the time of this writing, older GPUs and their drivers do not have cuda 12.8 support, so
  the image you have to build for the 50-series will not work on older GPUs.
