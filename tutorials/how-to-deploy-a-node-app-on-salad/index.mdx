title: 'How to deploy a Node App on Salad'
---

In this guide, we will build a simple Node.js application, an image, and a container using the image then expose the
local host using Cloud flare “Cloudflared” tunnels with free Cloudflare tunnels and deploy on
[SaladCloud Container Engine (SCE)](https://docs.salad.com/docs)

## **Prerequisites**

- A Node.js app that you have developed and tested locally
- A [SaladCloud Container Engine(SCE) account](https://docs.salad.com/docs/register-on-salad-portal)
- Git installed on your local machine

## **How to dockerize a Node.js application**

Before we begin, let’s be sure ** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) ** and
**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)** is installed on our system.

If Docker is not, you can use the links below to download it based on your chosen Operating System (OS) :

- **[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)**
- **[Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)**
- **[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)**

To confirm if your **Node.js** has successfully been installed in your machine, open your (CLI tool) command prompt or
desired terminal and type this command. This will display the version of the installed **`Nodejs`**

**`node -v`**
