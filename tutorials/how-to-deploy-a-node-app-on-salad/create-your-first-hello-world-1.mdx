## **Creating a _"hello world"_ Node.js Application**

First, we will start by creating a directory for our project and then install some dependencies for our simple “Hello
world” app using the command line.

```shell
mkdir nodejs-server

cd nodejs-server
```

**Install npm And Express Framework: **  
Install npm and Express, which is a Node.js framework.

**Then, initialize npm** in our directory.  
Copy or use the command below in your command line or terminal.

```shell
npm init
```

Above, **`npm`** creates a **`package.json`** that holds the dependencies of the app.

**Next, **install the Express framework dependency.

```shell
npm install express --save
```

Codebase should look like this below:

**Create a package.json file with the following content:**

```json
{
  "name": "node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

**Create an app.js file with an HTTP server that will return Hello world.**

Here is the code below :

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// This tells the app which port to listen to
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port`)
})

//This shows the response that will sent to the user
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World')
})
```

**Now, Save this file above, open your terminal, CLI (Command Line) to run the application**

```shell
node app.js
```

The app is now ready to launch:

It will show you on your terminal **_`Server is running on port 5000`_**

Go to your browser, copy and paste ** `http://localhost:8080/` ** in your browser to view it.

Here is a **_“Hello world”_** output on my browser :
