## Create a new Organization and Project

An Organization allows you to collaborate with your team. Once you create an organization, you can invite others to
collaborate.

A project acts like a group or a folder to group your resources under. A common example is to create one project for
`production` and another for `development`, ensuring you don't make a change in the wrong environment.

## Add a Billing Method

Your SaladCloud organization must have a billing method associated with it in order to deploy a container or use any of
the inference endpoints.
