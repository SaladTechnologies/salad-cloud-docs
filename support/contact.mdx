SaladCloud Support is normally available Monday through Friday from 9am to 5pm Pacific Time. We respond to requests
based on the level of your support plan and the order your message was received.

Your SaladCloud account automatically includes our basic support plan. This allows you to open an unlimited number of
support tickets with prioritized help for account login, billing, and security issues. We can also provide general
guidance on SaladCloud products and services. We will initially respond to basic support tickets for account login,
billing, and security issues within one business day. Otherwise, we will initially respond to all other support tickets
within two business days.

## Opening a Support Ticket

Opening a SaladCloud Support ticket is as easy as sending an email to cloud@salad.com. If your request is specific to an
existing SaladCloud account, you must use the same email address associated with your SaladCloud account.

Alternatively, you may use the support widgets available on this documentation website and the SaladCloud Portal.

On this documentation website, click on the message icon in the bottom right corner of the page that looks like the
following:
